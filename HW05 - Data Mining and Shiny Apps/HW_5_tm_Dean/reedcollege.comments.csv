"As someone having a hard time choosing between majors, I want to ask you what led you to anthropology. I'm considering either English or anthropology, planning to take Intro and an english course next year to see what they're like. Do you have any advice for a potential anthro major?",bsonk,2011-08-30 18:33:23
"Entering into sophomore year I had the same predicament, and I did exactly what you're describing: taking intro and an english course at the same time (I actually did anthro and english both semesters that year) and while I liked both, the contrast definitely helped me recognize why for me an anthropology degree was the way to go.",Scoldering,2011-08-30 18:59:25
"Could you elaborate on what led you to the choice? At your leisure of course. Also, I'm wondering what kind of jobs are out there for someone with a bachelor's in anthropology.",bsonk,2011-08-30 19:09:46
"I would warn you in taking advice from me that I'm only using my anthropology degree 'obliquely' these days; that is to say, I think it informs my current career in music &amp; entertainment, but it's definitely not necessary nor is it particularly the skill-set that got me in the front door to begin with. I have a lot of thoughts about what my degree can do for me directly, but I think it'll depend upon environmental/economic conditions down the road whether I choose to pursue these thoughts practically.

However, I do have two close friends who graduated around me who are currently pursuing academic careers in anthropology - and a quick survey of others I know shows a lot of similar things. A lot of the anthro folks I know are world travelling types - I know another who does advocacy work.....to me, while one of my strong identities in the world is as an anthropologist, I chose to study it not because I was considering the potential job market for it, but because it is to me the trippiest of all disciplines - that is to say, it is the thing in which I consistently find the greatest sense of awe and inspires in me some of the more profound questions I can ask. To me, being a human being and always from a young age being questionable about the assumptions our society makes about what we should value and how we should identify ourselves, I was already an individual and I came to Reed on a strong quest to understand better what it is that made me like the rest of the species. I found the problems that the English discipline was working on useful but too specific to textual analysis to handle the broader nature of my concern. In anthropology I found methods to tackle my inquiry head-on, and ethnographic evidence not merely of the ways but also the whys of the creation of meaning in amongst communities and its members. I'm capable of writing way more long-winded sentences than these. I feel as though anthropology has informed my personal politics and the way I carry myself in the world, my desire and ability to be a good guest, my sense of what is real. I haven't figured out half of what I want to know about within the discipline, but studying it definitely helped bring me a sense of inner peace with my own human nature that has brought me closer to others and made me feel more comfortable in my own skin, and I would consider these to be successes of my efforts thus far.

I don't know what you need to get out of your life, so I can't tell you that anthropology is necessarily for you, but it was good for me. I did discover Donald Barthelme in one of my english classes at Reed, and he's become my favorite author and muse to my own creative process, so I know that further down the road of the English discipline must lie plenty more things that can bring greater fullness to my life as well.",Scoldering,2011-08-30 20:19:58

Something is gravely wrong.

The fact is that there is only one person campaigning to convince the rest of the world that this is all an overreaction to a comment about a bogus statistic by a group of feeble minded students and a tenured professor at Reed College whose ideology and classes are arguably focused on civil rights.",Oakshot,2015-03-20 16:20:43

I would definitely like to hear more from Savery to understand exactly what warrants ""disruptive behavior."" I would also like to know if these discussions were about rape, or if they were discussing Roman and Greek art and True just started spouting random arguments about rape and the holocaust without them being pertinent to the discussion at hand.",elborracho420,2015-03-20 16:36:30

Moreover, that study found other results that seem wildly off. For instance, it found just as many cases of men being made-to-penetrate as it did with women getting raped which sounds off. Importantly, Mary Koss isn't exactly unbiased. She's a very hardcore feminist and an apologist when it comes to male rapes, which is probably why made-to-penetrate was defined under other sexual violence instead of rape, despite having literally exactly the same definition in that study as female rape (other than the part where the man is the penetrator).

The college staff also asked a student to modify a class on fermentation, which promised students, including underage students, instruction on how to make all the “booze … they could ever desire.” The student was asked to teach his class without the alcohol component, again for health and safety issues.
Alcohol and drugs cause significant and sometimes lethal harm to students at colleges and universities across the country. As you know, I have already seen several of our students go to the hospital because of dangerous misuse of both alcohol and drugs.
As president, I take seriously my responsibility for the health and safety of our community members. I am sorry about the lack of process that preceded these cancellations. Normally, I would wish to have a larger community dialogue, with full community participation, before taking any such steps. Unfortunately, I learned about these classes right before Paideia began and felt I could not responsibly let them go forward without real risk of harm to community members.
In the coming weeks, I will schedule a community forum, in which students may share their concerns about this decision. I will gladly listen as well as explain my own views.

Intro metaphysics with Hinchliff was all about Hume and Descartes, and then analytical philosophers from the first half of the 20th century. The history majors I know love to talk about Foucault, and I've heard that's a bit passé these days.

"Well it was the only school that could fit my [hipster needs](http://twibbon.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/81/989643e2-50e7-4c44-be53-1d7b39801520_Twitter.png)

Jk. Seriously though, I was doing a college research paper for my Junior English class in the spring of 2011, and we had to pick out 3 colleges to write a paper on. I was that one really smart guy who had no idea where he wanted to go to college but could get in pretty much anywhere based on test scores and GPA alone, but I ended up picking New York University based on location, UC Berkeley based on prestige, and Reed based on the fact that my counselor had mentioned that it might be a good fit for me.

So, a lot of research later, I basically figured out that Reed is super-serious yet self-effacing in its reputation. I've heard it as a school for ""misunderstood geniuses"" and ""clove-smoking, treehugging vegetarians.""  Beyond that, the whole grading system and Paideia Week thing were really interesting to me after I had an interview with Beth Barteletti (or however that name goes). 

Naturally, being a stressed out high-school senior with rough classes, a serious relationship, and a reputation as a stellar athlete to uphold, I wanted to get college worries out of the way early. So I applied early decision, and they just told me last Thursday that they've accepted me.

Basically just stoked on life right now . . .",snorky94,2011-12-18 13:39:50
"Stoked on life - I sympathize.  Does the admissions office still fill the acceptance envelope with confetti?

You're certainly right about Reed being super-serious, especially after freshman year when the workload picks up.  Don't expect your profs to treat you as misunderstood geniuses, though - we're just smart students who work hard.  Their job isn't to make us feel good; their job is to train us to produce top-notch academic content.

Reed may have some sort of reputation as harboring strong hipster culture, but the scene isn't nearly as pervasive as, say, Williamsburg, or even other neighborhoods in Portland.  I tend to view the hipster students as more or less the equivalent of any high school clique which tends to dress the same.  Fashion sense isn't really important around here, except maybe in the coffee shops and designated smoking areas.

I loved the damn thing. I know that Rand's name carries very negative fire and shit with it, but the politics of Rand is contained mostly in *Atlas Shrugged*. *Fountainhead*'s pretty free of that stuff.


I just slogged through *Wuthering Heights*, and I found that I liked *Jane Eyre* infinitely better.

I can't describe *The Prophet* by Gibran . . . it's too amazing. I keep rereading it. 

I don't care if it's just Peter Pan all over again, I still love the innocence and sadness of *The Little Prince*.

"No, it was a Sunday so i just walked around for 30 mins. I wish I was there longer. I'm only a junior but I think my SAT and GPA are already up to par (especially if they superscore). So i'm content, but my mom dislikes the school for 3 reasons, the kids, the size and the cost. I personally like the size. I want a small knit community. She thinks that the student body is too weird and addicted to drugs, but then again I do go to the most liberal, free-spirited high school in all of San Diego so how bad can it be. Lastly, she is concerned about the cost, which makes perfect sense. I will probably only receive like 5,000 dollars worth of financial aid because we are just barely considered upper middle class. What points do you suggest I bring up to my mom to persuade her in the financial area and her other concerns about Reed?",,2013-11-13 19:28:29
"Huh! Well, if you have the chance to go back I'd really encourage you to sit in on a class. That's where the real meat of the Reed experience is to be found.

Regarding kids, size, and cost:

I don't think the student body is weird and addicted; I think they're weird. If she fears you'll encounter abnormal people at Reed, she's quite right. As for drugs - you'll have access to any drug you want on *any* college campus in the US. Going to Reed doesn't make it any easier to smoke pot or drop acid than going to UC Berkeley. If she fears that you'll encounter drugs at Reed, she's also right - but much of the pot on campus comes up from California. It's not as if she'll protect you from drugs by sending you to another college.

I don't think the size of the school has anything to do with her. Why does she care how many students go there? Is she afraid she won't be able to party hard enough when she visits you?

The cost is expensive. It's also comparable with other good private colleges. There's very little way out of that. I received about 50% financial aid, and my family paid the rest. I'm currently paying the loans off, although I should be done before the end of the calendar year (yay!).

Underneath it all, I'm not sure that cost, kids, and size are what defines Reed. I think a serious application warrants a closer look.",basquefire,2013-11-13 19:43:22
"Haha "" Is she afraid she won't be able to party hard enough when she visits you?"" No, it's not that, IDK exactly what it is but she is apposed to small schools.

"Reed is a very difficult school, although not impossible, with a student body that consists of mostly ""normal"" people, but  with enough wacky/interesting people to make weird things happen. Your freshman and sophomore years are generally enjoyable and full of socialization, although you will hate it at some points because the workload is so heavy and the weather outside is so gross. Your junior year will probably have an even heavier workload, but you will be more used to it and your concept of socialization changes into meetings with your professors and doing homework with classmates. I'm about to be a senior. I'm excited to thesis!

There of course is a party scene, you only need to use google to find that out. The administration is currently cracking down on more illicit activities, so one has to be discreet and smart about one is doing, as with anywhere else. Portland is really awesome, but it's VERY easy to get stuck in ""the bubble"" and never leave. Don't do that. Portland is great and easy to get around. Jump on a bus somewhere. 

There are various extracurriculars and student groups that do cool things. Unfortunately a lot of them are only around/active for a semester before people get busy and start doing their own thing. This is a chronic problem IMO. 

At some points I should have transferred, but I decided to stick it through and I'm happy for it. Reed has helped mold me into a person that I'm very happy being. 

If you are a hard science major, expect even less time to socialize/party.

"Relaxed/not relaxed mostly depends on the dorm. Some are really community-driven, and some are just a bunch of individual people living in one building keeping to themselves. As a (rough) rule, the suckier your dorm building is, the more community it has. So, FSM and cross-canyons have tighter communities than the Grove and Naito-Sullivan. Then again, many of the theme dorms are stuck in the suckier buildings, so maybe that has more to do with it.

I lived in the Grove and later in Mad Sci (Foster), and each year my dormmates were always super chill. Barely any drama. It might be worth noting that I was an introvert and wasn't at all involved in the party scene (was there one? I don't know these things).",elile,2013-08-21 01:22:19

"My family covered about what your family is willing to cover. All of the rest of it was covered by financial aid, which was a combination of federally subsidized loans (stafford &amp; perkins), federal grants, and Reed grants. Because I was a slightly older transfer student, I declared myself financially independent after my sophomore year. The school thereafter determined my aid package based on an examination of my own finances, instead of my parents'. My aid went up.

In addition to the other recommendations in this thread, I'd also like to point out that many Reedies opt to move off campus immediately after freshman year. For some it's a cost-saving measure; others just want the independence and privacy. Either way, off-campus living is a huge part of Reed culture. Cheap rent can be had within biking distance of Reed for &lt;$300/month. You can live in a Reed house, teach yourself to cook, and cut your room/board costs in half.

Also, Reed provides students with many opportunities for work-study. Reedies man the circulation and reception desks, clean the grounds, tutor other students, serve as HAs for free room and board, and perform various other tasks in exchange for cash or tuition credit. If you visit (and it's a very good idea to visit), be sure to tell your dorm host you'd like to learn about the work-study experience.

Reed also offers its students research grants. I applied for a competitive in-house grant, and my research proposal was accepted. I earned $3,800 during the summer before senior year, and it turned out to be an amazing project.

Ok, so there are all sorts of ways to game the high costs of Reed. 

That being said: it is my understanding that Reed is notably behind the curve when it comes to providing its graduates with lucrative jobs. Alumni and administration alike are working hard to make Reedies more competitive in the workplace, but it's gonna be a long road. 
The bottom line is: a Reed diploma is not a ticket to a salaried job. If you go into debt to pay for this world-class intellectual experience, be aware that you'll be at a real disadvantage post-graduation if you don't learn to hustle somewhere along the way.",basquefire,2012-12-25 18:43:53

"You know, I've thought about this for the better part of a day now. Someone alluded to it already in /r/Oregon, but I'm worried about this student's capacity for violence. I don't say that lightly.

You have a young black man with a serious inferiority complex towards white women, overblown, narcissistic sense of self, a penchant for grandiosity, who has already written a manifesto about how he hopes to change Reed as an institution, and who has a martyr complex where he specifically idolizes the scenario of death while standing up for his personal beliefs. He has shown little to no regard for other's emotions. Last I read, he's dropped out of all of his classes and he obviously has strong feelings of being ostracized by the world.

There's no reason to be afraid or paranoid, but to ignore the warning signs and/or to not have thought about the dangers of living on a modern college campus is foolish. Hoping the administration is keeping an eye on the situation is fallacy; they have no way to protect you if someone intends to harm you or others. I'm sorry if this comes across as disconcerting, that's not my intent, but I do like to challenge people to think about their personal security and their awareness.

"Interview: **BE GENUINE.** They can see through any shit someone might say just to win them over. Just relax and be yourself; the school appreciates individuals. That being said, make sure you come across as being really motivated because to go here, you NEED to be motivated, self-driven, and be prepared for the work because if you're not, it'll fuck you over pretty hard. That also follows suit with the loving learning and you should try to emphasize something along those lines because that's a huge characteristic for Reedies. We're smart people that would like to be smarter than we are, so we try hard to be.

Also, **ASK QUESTIONS**. Come up with questions you have so you can better assess where Reed falls on your ""Where I Want to Go"" list. Ask the admissions officier, any current students, and maybe professors if you happen to have a moment with them questions. This is an excellent opportunity to learn what you're getting into so get as much information as you can.

I showed up in a dress and heels just because that's pretty much how I dress everyday, but do what feels right for you. If you'd feel better wearing khakis and a button up, do it. Just don't forget to be yourself and be confident (but not pretentiously arrogant, please)! :P 

By the way, if they can tell you're really interested the school (which is seems you are) and you're pretty well qualified with a solid ""Why Reed?"" essay, it'll work in your favor I'm sure.

Reed is cool because you get a ton of lab experience (4 hours per week per lab class) in a number of different fields.

You also get a fair amount of discussion experience plus tons of time reading primary lit (much rarer than i thought, after comparing with some fellow students).  Theres also thesis, which is really awesome.

Im working with one of the top guys in my field and getting a full fellowship while doing it, so im happy!

And yes, reed has plenty of classes. There will be about 4-6 uppder div bio classes listed per semester, with maybe a dozen available in the course of four years.  I took two per semester for junior year and one per semester sophomore (o-chem!) and senior (thesis!) years, so i ended up doing a significant portion of all the upper div classes possible.  You wont lack options, however your options are limited by the types of professor at Reed.  You'll get all the basics, but there's no mammal guy, for example. The classes offered are to some degree dictated by the professors' areas of expertise.

Conference classes are available strating sophomore year, and come in a much greater variety, but meet only once per week and dont include a lab section.

that said, one of the most brilliant people i know is a product of the school.

what did you think of the student life, and the academics?",dvoge,2012-05-03 20:33:54
"Student life and academics at Evergreen are both actually shit - or at the best, they're hit-or-miss.

The primary pasttime is smoking pot.  I smoked my brains out for the two years I was there.

Student activities are a joke; the campus is culturally and geographically removed from Olympia - which is itself culturally impoverished; racism and reverse-racism abound among the student body.

The academics are a total crapshoot.  My understanding is that at its inception (in the 70s, I think), Evergreen was intended to attract self-motivated, creative students who were capable of writing their own curricula.  The project attracted bright young faculty from top-tier East Coast schools, and they strove to create an environment in which grades (and the associated competition) were secondary to a student's individual intellectual growth.

However, at this point in time the lack of standards is, in my opinion, the school's greatest weakness.  Evergreen has no grades, majors, or graduation requirements.  This means two things: 1) one may simply take classes until enough credits are acquired to graduate, regardless of performance, and 2) prospective students *apply* there because they know they can get by with lack of standards.

When I was at Evergreen, the acceptance rate was ~90%.  Now it's pushing 95%.  This means that basically anyone can get in.  And applicants know it.

Because individuals don't receive grades - but rather individual evaluations (which are often copy-pasted by faculty anyway) - there is very little motivation to do the reading, and come to conference with interesting thought.  However, the entire educational model is grounded in the conference experience.

The end result is: the education you receive there is completely dependent on how much effort your peers wish to invest.  And many of your peers will have applied because they know that they can obtain a degree with a bare minimum of effort.

The Evergreen model has failed.  The only way to get a good education at Evergreen - and I was not self-disciplined enough to do this - is to identify a faculty member of unrecognized talent, and to work closely with that faculty member for 4 years, designing and executing your own curriculum.",basquefire,2012-05-03 23:01:22

"renn fayre was last weekend, actually :)

Anyway, this seems like an appropriate time to share a couple of my opinions on Reed, as a junior who is leaving temporarily after this semester. After three years at Reed, like a LOT of other people here, I'm feeling burned the fuq out. I've had a great time, but the truth is that the most important thing I've learned here is that I'm not a ""Reedie."" Many students at Reed aren't Reedies. By that I mean: I'm here, I passed my classes, and I even learned some shit, but unlike a true Reedie, I didn't enjoy devoting every hour to academia, which at Reed comes in the form of EPIC HOMEWORK TIME. Reed's course work focuses on the theoretical and the abstract, to the almost-deliberate exclusion of practical knowledge from the curriculum. That's an opinion that I share with a pretty sizable portion of the student body, I think, and it's not a good thing - at least not for me.

You mentioned that your sister left Reed after a semester. I don't know if she just wasn't doing homework, or missing classes, or what. But you need to realize something that I didn't acknowledge when I decided to come here. You're going to need to work harder than you'll want to, and you'll question your motivation for doing this to yourself to the point where, if you don't really fucking want to do it, then you just won't do it. That's the point where I'm at, so I'm leaving to work in Boston for a year before I come back to write my thesis and graduate. Also, I failed the math major junior qual - which is uncommon, I'll admit, but not unheard of - so I want time to get ready to retake it before I can start my thesis.

Take my opinion with a whole lot of grains of salt, because it's the opinion of someone who has really come to hate life here, and your mileage is likely to vary. Many people I talk to love it here, many people are ambivalent, and many are way worse off than I am. So just realize that, if you don't get a huge amount of financial aid (which was what enabled me to come here, and with which Reed is VERY generous) you're going to be digging yourself into some pretty damn deep debt, and if you don't know for sure that you want it badly enough to carry on all the way from Hum. 110, to all your group requirements, to your major requirements, through your junior qualifying exam, through your senior thesis, through your oral defense, and then after that maybe even getting a fabled real-life-job - if you don't want all that badly enough, then you're going to be pretty upset when you run out of steam at the end of your third year, and there's still a marathon left to run. That's what I think! 

So if I'm making sense, and you think that my experience here might be valuable to you, just keep it in mind. I can tell you more, if you'd like. I don't want to paint Reed as a soulless professor-factory, because it's not, but I also think that Reed's ""communism, atheism, free love, no grades, learning-for-its-own-sake"" image is a bullshit facade that we need to grow out of repeating, because it's not true either.",,2012-05-03 12:28:28
"I'll be graduating with a Physics degree in a few weeks, and, while a lot of this agrees with my experience, I want to make one point:

One thing that people keep saying that I don't think is true: Reed does not require you to enjoy the endless hours of work that result from procrastinating that semester project until the last weekend. I know I don't enjoy all of it. Instead, you really need a borderline neurotic desire to create something in which you take pride. The process doesn't have to be fun the entire time, but it has to be worth it for the final product. I have no idea how anyone finishes their thesis without this.",KingOfThePark,2012-05-03 15:10:11
"Thanks, ""enjoy"" was the wrong word. I'm not talking about being happy with the whole experience, and being so stoked about getting a problem set that you just can't help but do it the night you get it. Nobody's like that really, unless they're actually insane. So yeah, you're right about needing a ""borderline neurotic desire"" and that is essentially what I'm lacking at this point.

Hopefully a change of pace and scenery for a while will give me at least one thesis' worth of motivation by the time I get back.",,2012-05-03 15:26:28
"oh my mistake on Renn Fayre... i hope it was as extreme as per usual...

though your post depressed me, i think it is an extremely valid, very important aspect of Reed people should heavily consider once contemplating what they want out of a college education, and im quite glad you have provided it in a way that only an upperclassmen may term it.",dvoge,2012-05-03 16:00:07
"Hahaa, I'm sorry for all the gloom/doom. Look, I don't know what type of person you are. Reed attracts a rather diverse crowd, so there's no reason to think you'll experience it in the same way as I have. The truth is, of course, that Reed is just another school. It's just hard, and people love to have dick-measuring contests in the form of ""I spent TWENTY EIGHT HOURS STRAIGHT in the library suck it bitch"" and I hear that and can't think anything but ""........ ummmmmm cool story bro."" I don't like that type of social atmosphere, and I don't like what I perceive to be pretentiousness and unnecessary competitiveness. That is the type of person I am, and the reason I ended up here is because I didn't know how things were actually going to be.

So all I'm saying is: think about who *you* are, and if you feel like a Reedie, then go to Reed, and if you don't, then don't. Don't think that you're going to become a different person, don't make unrealistic expectations for yourself, and don't go to Reed just because you want fun people and drugs and free love/whatever, because you can get that anywhere.

Best of luck with whatever you decide to do! It's FAR from impossible to have an amazing time at Reed - I felt reasonably good about being here for a very long time before I realized it just wasn't for me. And let me just say that, yes, Renn Fayre ALMOST makes it all worth it every year. But only if you take enough acid.

"i can relate with you on some levels.... i've never looked at an A+ student, and thought that was an accurate measure of their value or intelligence...simply because that person had sacrificed their time to reading the same thing over and over...

my intelligence is complicated to explain, as is my interest in education, but it might be said that i am of the mind that Reed tries to attract, but does not cater well too.

i do procrastinate quite a bit, and studying has almost been a dirty word to me, as most know;edge just comes to me naturally.

when i see myself as a 'Reedie,' admittedly i understand that the studiousness is something i may have to cultivate, that i dont especially like now, but think i could get really into. really what its more about to me, is that i love learning, discussion, i have a constant thirst for knowledge to delve into the matters that interest me.

"I think you've got a healthy attitude, to be honest.  As you say, though it'll be a big change (perhaps in climate more than anything), it is exciting, and should be taken in stride.  Reed can be a really great place, but be prepared to get shat on with the workload.  Freshman year isn't too bad at all, and you'll be prepared for the work when the time comes, but by the end of the semester, I know I still get pretty burned out (speaking as a second semester junior, also Poli Sci (good choice)).

There are a lot of hipsters (it is Portland, after all), and a lot of [college liberals](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/225/284/35kdvz.jpg) (that picture actually is reflective of a larger portion of the Reed population than one might expect / be comfortable with), but if anything, Reed is good at teaching people how to articulately express their opinions.  Unfortunately, Reed isn't so good at teaching people how to learn when they should shut the fuck up, or just not say anything at all, but it's all a learning experience.

I know this doesn't really contain any life-changing words of wisdom, but if you've read generic reviews online, talked to people, heard about the workload, and are still excited about coming to Reed, I'd say you're doing it right.  Just be prepared for any sort of crazy you might imagine, and welcome to the family.

A final thought: people on your floor **will** drop out, Reed can be intense.  Don't let the work get to you, though.  It'll always seem like a lot, and will seem like it never ends (I know I certainly feel that way right now), but you should just remember that in the end, everything will be okay, and that you'll get out of an education what you put in.  Give it your best, and Reed will make you a baller (intellectually speaking, of course).  Also, on behalf of (almost) all of the other people here, please try to shower at least twice a week.

doobad is correct. The weather will be a bit of change. A more or less permanent mist from November to March. I think the one piece of advice I'd give has to do with work ethic. Reed is intense. Lots of people drop out. The way to cope with it is having good work habits. I was really attracted to the social side of things and it bit me. If I could magically gift you with one ability it would be the ability to research and write a good five page paper.

Campus culture essentially encourages recreational drug use, casual sex, and general debauchery.

Coming from an environment in which even music concerts are banned, you are basically guaranteed to undergo massive culture shock. It may be incredibly liberating, but it will also likely be very uncomfortable.

"Senior physics major here: Physics is hard. I love it but man, sometimes I want my fucking life back. I couldn't compare it to other colleges seeing as I haven't been to any other colleges, but all my friends still have time to fucking play League of Legends. Admittedly I did most of it to myself, which is really what Reed is about - you can make it as easy  (to some lower bound) or as hard as you want. 

Which is what makes it hard, since it's so fucking easy to be like ""yeah I can totally figure out how OpenFOAM works in a month while also thesising"" or ""yeah I can totally take 5 physics classes in a semester"" and then you realize no, no you cant you fucking idiot, but it's too late and now you're up to 3 AM writing shitty perl scripts and whining on the internet to procrastinate. Also my professors totally enable this kind of thing - which might be good or bad depending on you. I'm not yet sure myself. Hope this tired rambling helps. ",melkorthefoul,2014-12-14 01:52:16
"As to what makes Reed characteristically hard, I would say that one of the defining parts of Reed is that almost every department treats its intro classes as if only majors in that department were taking that class. The result is that almost every class you take is intense and very focused - there are no (or almost no) ""filler"" courses. 

To add to that, people make it worse for themselves a lot of the time - there are majors like physics where after your Sophomore year is over, *every* course you take is in your major, but I would say that most of the time people take courses based on whether or not they find them interesting, not based on how much work you're expected to put in. 

Most of my experience at this point is in math or econ, which definitely colors your perspective. I've been told that many of the courses you take after intro econ are more or less the courses that those professors took when they got their master's or PhD. The math department is totally theoretical, and thus kind of a clusterfuck at times.",tooproudtopose,2014-12-30 22:58:38
"Getting into Reed is all about the fit. It is very different from WashU, and pretty different from UChicago. Some things that are characteristic of Reedies are that we're passionate, weird, well-read, relatively politically/socially active, and we do it because we love it. Most WashU kids would find us really, really strange, from the jars of bubbling kombucha scoby's to the research hallucinogens to staying up until sunrise talking about sociological power dynamics and magic the gathering. 

(Those are just examples. There's a wide variety of Reedies here who are into and not into all sorts of things, pretty much we're all nerdy about what we love and curious about what we don't know.) 

Reed is hard because of the work expected from you. The average GPA here is around a B-, and a lot of professors grade on a true curve, where the average grade is a C. I realized this year that as a junior, I should be getting A's in upper level classes only if I truly have a working knowledge of 95% of the material. 

You will not see the sunlight your junior year of college if you're a physics major. Physics here is slanted towards the theoretical side of things in order to breed physics professors, it is one of the most stressful majors at one of the most stressful colleges partly because of that and partly because of the culture in the department, which is a ""make or break"" kind of thing. Also, the most of the people in physics are white males, which makes it a lot more difficult if you're not. If you love physics, the physics department is for you, regardless of your identity. Love of physics is what holds it together. 

I didn't love physics enough. I loved building things, which is pragmatic, so when a colleague of mine told me ""if you're having trouble, you should give up,"" I realized that it's just not worth it to fight against the belief that I'm not welcome as a female in physics. (Like come on - it was multivariable calculus, intuitive for less than .01% of the population and everyone else is also having trouble because it's the hardest major.) I am also now a bitter biology major and you should take my perspective with a grain of salt. (Except I love love biology.) 

I hear good things about the physics department, but have only taken organic chemistry, which could be worse. It's significantly easier than physics. Then again, so is everything.",ecoevodevo,2014-12-14 16:53:09

I'm a prospective transfer. What is like to be a math major at Reed?,pillowpuff,2013-08-30 10:25:14
"How far are you along at your current school? I have a friend who transferred in wanting to do math, but ended up doing psych because they were nicer to her with allowing her to get out of classes and accepting transfer credits. I think the earlier you transfer the better (or more aptly the longer you're willing to spend at Reed, the better).

I started out wanting to do physics, but over time became more interested in math and less interested in physics. People often complain about Reed math being ""too theoretical,"" but I think they're comparing it to high school math classes which more aptly should be called ""computation."" Everything in Reed math is proof based. I found while math and physics were both challenging, physics was doing variations of the same problem over and over where math was generally showing that it was solvable and then moving on. Don't get me wrong, I respect physicists, but I just really enjoyed the logical portion of mathematics and the variety of topics that we got to cover.

Math is a small department that's split between algebraists and annalists (with one odd man out-more on him in a second). You have a few required classes (from memory: intro to analyst, calculus, MVC, linear algebra, real analyst, and abstract algebra), but then after that you're free to choose a side. Different professors have different styles, but generally problem sets are assigned once or twice a week, and are generally a mix of a few difficult proofs and usually a handful of simpler computational problems. They usually try to tie things into what you've done in other classes or to other subjects in math (abstract algebra could almost be named ""group theory""). This is because they are generally trying to prepare you to do research, such as REUs, or grad school and of course your thesis (I never took probability and statistics, but was able to go off what I had learned from abstract and physics lab to get by). The junior qualifying exam (big test to show you're ready to thesis) isn't the hardest, but isn't the easiest either.

So the odd man out that I mentioned before is Jim, my former thesis adviser. Jim does theory of computation/computer science, and has been referred to as a ""one man department."" Aside from scientific computation (physics), all classes in the vein of CS are taught by Jim. He still is very much a math professor though. Most of his classes are theory based, with exercises in implementation. Most classes are taught using functional languages, although Java and C are in there. But don't go to Reed if you want to do CS though.

I'm not really sure what else to say, but if you have more specific questions feel free to ask.",chucho_0,2013-08-30 12:01:11
"Thanks for the information! I just started my first year at community college. I've recently had interest in applying to Reed this year or the next, but I'm kind of hesitant because in California my tuition for cc and a UC is waived.

"Reed teaches math a bit differently than a lot of places. You don't need Calculus before you enter, but it can help. It's highly unlikely that you'll test out of first year calc at reed even if you take a whole year of calc, because Reed teaches proofs first rather than calculations... most other places teach you how to do the calculations first, and much later you learn why they work. 

One year of community college can be a good thing to transfer in from though - plenty of people do. Reed has excellent need-based financial aid too.",mimrm,2013-08-30 17:52:30

"I'm happy with my decision. I graduated last year with a debt load equivalent to about half of my current yearly salary, which I feel is manageable.

""Happy"" is a relative term; I'd prefer to have far less debt than I do, but I also know that tens of thousands of dollars in debt is basically unavoidable unless one A) is both very poor and very talented (and therefore receives a full ride or a near-full ride), or B) has parents wealthy enough to pay for 4 years of private-school tuition.

I work full-time as a tutor now, and I speak with parents about the costs of tuition. Many middle-class families now face the prospect of paying in excess of 200k, total, for four years of college. These colleges are good private colleges, but in my personal estimation they don't even come close to meeting the ""Reed Experience.""

When slogging through sophomore/junior/senior coursework, I didn't idealize my experience at all. But during my Senior Renn Fayre, I was hanging out with some non-Reedie buddies and reflecting on all the crazy ups and downs of my undergraduate experience. One of them observed that I'd had ""the ideal undergraduate experience."" At the time, I thought he was just paying me a compliment during my thesis-submision afterglow, but since then I've come to realize that most of my peers' experience at other schools were pretty mundane by comparison.

Two Caveats for prospies like yourself to consider:

-I had a fairly odd experience at Reed. I transferred in, underwent some personal disasters, recovered, and wrote a highly personal thesis. I don't think my experience was typical. I have former classmates who left Reed, and they made sound decisions.

-Your mileage may vary. In my personal opinion, Reed is currently at a weird crossroads as the administration tries to figure out how to shape the school's image for the next 5-10 years. This happens every couple decades, and the Reed I attended may not be the same Reed you'll attend.

My time at Reed basically turned me into a thinking adult. I made some pretty severe mistakes, but I made it out alive - and I value my experience there in a way that can't be quantified.

There are a good number of factors involved: the amount of debt you'll face, your other college options, your personal fit with Reed, etc. If you want to talk about this a bit more, shoot me a PM. ",basquefire,2013-04-29 07:15:29

"ok, to give it to you straight, if you do end up staying at reed for 4 years, you'll probably love it to bits freshman year, then either sophomore or jr year go through a period where you're like ""oh my god what have i done? what am i doing here?"" and it might be really rough. a lot of people don't make it past that time, or have to take time off before coming back (or not) which is fine if that's your life path! but very few leave reed unhappy about having gone. 

i would say my least favorite part is that people are so overburdened with work that a lot of people just don't have the mindspace and heartspace left over to really show compassion for other people sometimes, which i find really sad, but i struggled through it and can say that i'm happy i did reed (i say this as i'm about to start my senior year!). i think most people find good people they can share the times with, and even though i never really found any very good friends, i'm alive, kickin, and happy anyway. it really is only 4 (or 5 or 6!) years of your life. i gotta say though, the comraderie gets me through it all. for me, that's my favorite part. you feel like you're part of a solid community there (and you feel it most of all at renn fayre). also the professors are awesome.",salawhat,2012-08-19 06:08:01
"I can't speak much to the polisci department, but the philosophy department I can talk about. If you are planning on taking any sort of philosophy classes hoping to read continental philosophy, you're shit out of luck. What we have at reed is really solid, but what it is is mainly analytic philosophy. As far as professors go, I haven't had any negative experiences with any professors in the phil department, but I can certainly recommend Bedau, Hovda, and Hinchliff. Early classes don't have as much in the way of essays, but they still mainly have readings for every class session. Junior seminar is a big thing that all the phil majors take together, but the topic changes every year. 

Looking over it, I don't think I emphasized exactly how well the philosophy department trains you to write and analyze arguments, so i'm gonna say that here so it doesn't get lost. ",OurLastHope,2012-07-10 01:17:05

"I won't be going to grad school. While I did love the schoolwork at Reed, I'm a circus person at heart, so I'm making my living with firespinning and circus arts now. You can read continental philosophy in the upper-division hum classes, if that's something that interests you. They'll give you a lot of in-depth understanding on what climate the philosophy came from in addition to an understanding of the philosophy itself. ",OurLastHope,2012-07-11 02:17:12

"If you want continental phil you should look at the anthro, literature analysis, and religion classes, whether or not you major in them. If you're interested in Poli-phil, it's all in the poli-sci department. The philosophy department is amazing in that they will kick your ass and you'll be smarter for it. They aren't your friends though. The best profs in the department are also the least friendly... but in a good way? I loved it. Continental phil sounds pretty but is often so vague that the author might mean anything. Analytical philosophy is the branch that masters logic to the degree of utmost precision that can destroy any argument you ever hear. ",ExistentialJoy,2012-08-17 21:48:59
"I have heard that. After some research, I'm leaning toward the political science dept. because my main interest is in political philosophy, and it seems as though Reed's political science dept. is very theoretically focused, so that's good. It really is a shame though because I do like continental - probably more than analytic but I also would like to learn the logic that comes with analytic philosophy.",PlatosRepubdick,2012-08-18 15:49:53
"As a rising poli sci senior, I'm likely biased, but the poli sci department's pretty sweet. Every teacher I've encountered thus far has been brilliant, and I can honestly say that I haven't had any bad experiences with my classes. With the way the sabbatical system in the department is set up, though, by the time you would arrive the year after next, there will be no international relations prof for the year. If you're planning on doing IR, it's still not a huge issue, as (Alex) Montgomery will be back the year after that, but it's just something to know in advance.

In terms of political philosophy, I've only taken the intro (with Darius Rejali, who is incredibly smart and knows it), but it was a great introduction to important political philosophers (admittedly all of whom were Western or Ancient Greek/Roman)—in no particular order: Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Aristotle, Schmitt, Marx, and maybe more, I don't have the syllabus any more. I've heard good things about the other poli phil profs (Metz, Steinberger), but a reputation the department has as a whole (not unwarranted) is that the profs tend to be somewhat arrogant. To be sure, there are those who are not at all full of themselves, but if you ever have a class with Steinberger, Rejali, or Gronke, be prepared. Also, if you're a girl, you may have a different experience with these teachers, unfortunately (the others are better about that, though).

I've found the workload to be totally acceptable and manageable, and now that I'm taking just upper-levels, the intros seem pretty tame, to be honest.

"this is unpopular, but part(s) of me were sympathetic to the arguments made by the trustees against divestment. that being said, i'm not under the delusion that the industrial complex devoted to fossil fuels is not running this planet under or bandit-ing communities resources for profit or elsewise a terrible scourge upon this earth. 

that being said - i can't help but think many of the points made in the  [trustees response](http://www.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2013-2014/071714_ffrletter.html) to fossil-free reed were both valid and sound (though perhaps morally dispassionate). i'll explain. 

first of - the primary objective of the board of trustees is fiduciary. its complete aim is to increase the endowment of the college so as to thereby benefit the school. its (ostensible) practice is not concerned with the complexities of second-tier moral implications related to investments. i know this seems like sort of a useless stipulation, because of course the board of trustees is concerned about the moral implications of their actions - it doesn't fund slave labor or genocide or what have you just because its a profitable return - it considers the weight of societal norms on its decisionsm but, i think, the point still stands. fossil fuels are an amazingly prevalent societal norm.  quote from the release:

&gt;*Some think that divesting Reed’s endowment from fossil-fuel investments would not have significant impact on actual CO2 emissions. Others stressed that in light of the college’s continued use of fossil fuels, and similar reliance on fossil fuels by nearly all of the members of our community, to the degree such a gesture would purport to contribute to a solution, it would lack the integrity we all expect from the Reed community. Some were animated principally by concern that the requested action would have a significant negative impact on the endowment.*

I'm not sure I can find anything unsound with these responses. again, morally dispassionate - but wrong? I'm not sure. i'd love to hear someones takedown of these points. ",daloc22,2014-07-30 09:13:43

"&gt; Granted I am focusing here on movement politics, but climate change is going to be solved by a robust climate movement, so divestment as a movement is helping.

i want to focus on the inference you're making here - you claim that climate change will be solved by a 'robust climate movement' (and i'm not entirely sure about your language here but am taking you to be saying a impassioned populace motivated to address the climate change issue), and so, therefore divestment as a movement is helping. 

i think your premise is unsound and therefore your conclusion doesn't follow. climate change can only be addressed by the individual decisions of the worlds population - we will only see progress when the incentives against fossil fuel use trump the positives. divestment does not interact with these concerns. it doesn't even recognize them. it only pallidly beseeches large corporations and institutions to put their money elsewhere without providing reasons or incentives outside of morally-tinged, altruistically ideological concerns. 

now, if we put aside the supposed moral standing of investment in fossil fuel companies for just a second, its no surprise why divestment is such a non-starter. divestment as a movement does nothing to address the incentives of businesses and institutions to invest as they will in the most profitable, legal areas. in its ideological refusal to level with the profit maximizing component of investment, it cedes the argument completely to the other side. corporations and institutions, despite what some tax law might say, are not people, and cannot motivated as people are by altruistic, 'common-good' concerns. they are motivated by incentives. what compelling argument can be made for divestment along these terms? i've yet to hear one.

"over a weekend in late april (it was about three weeks ago this year) you're given an article in some contemporary field of philosophy, by someone you may have heard of, and are expected to respond in a critical fashion to the papers argument, give an analysis of its import, or presumably voice some objection in eight hours. 

This year for instance, the paper was [D. Parfit, 'Is Common-Sense Morality Self-Defeating?'](http://individual.utoronto.ca/stafforini/parfit/parfit_-_is_common-sense_morality_self-defeating.pdf)

i think the department readers generally prefer carefully worded, neutral analysis and discussion in lieu of grand theoretical postulations or poor summary. as far as I know its pretty difficult to outright fail, but conditional passes can be abundant. If you get the latter you have to write a few long essays over the summer on some topics in the contemporary or historical literature.

"Reed's neat largely because all the concerns you have about fitting in and being told what to think are actually pretty irrelevant.  There are obviously some aloof groups who dont get out much, and the overwhelming worldview is socially and politically liberal, but for the most part students really seem to value each other's opinions.  Professors too, for what thats worth.

Honestly, the problem, if you think it is one, may be the opposite of what youre imagining.  Many reedies are a little reclusive and nerdy.  After starting grad school on the other side of the country im beginning to suspect that may be a universal on college campuses, but regardless, dont expect to be cajoled into an uncomfortably loaded conversation if you really dont want to be.

Long story short, Reedies are an accepting bunch, almost to a fault.  In my 4 years i talked politics and religion every now and then and i definitely moved between cliques on occasion.  Theres absolutely nothing to fear!  Theyre good people.

Edit:  when you visit, sit in on classes as often as possible.  Thats the real bread and butter of Reed.  We like being there, but we love learning, and educating is reeds strong suit.  Meet a few professors too, if you get a chance. You'll be seeing a lot of them compared to most schools.",JMCraig,2014-02-27 20:37:24

"I can't properly answer most of your questions - it's been too many years since I was at Reed to know what it's really like... but, I can give a few answers that might be partly helpful.  There are a lot of clubs and other outlets for being creative - and you can try out all sorts of classes without being a major too. I took a theater-design class and an acting class during my freshman year, just to try them out. (Though I did a lot of stage-building/design in high school). I also got a part time job for my first year helping out with building and painting theater sets. The department was very welcoming because the major is fairly small.

There are a TON of dance opportunities, and dance performance opportunities. Same goes for juggling. -- You can do them for physical education or just for fun. 

As far as art goes, if you want a proper drawing class (or other art classes) it's a major time investment. I signed up for a drawing (intro-art) class and then dropped it when I realized how many hours it would demand both in and out of class. But plenty of non-art majors enjoy that. There also are (or were? I imagine it still happens) so many art happenings - art just happens at reed. You'll find yourself welding bikes, painting big murals with people, creating weird big structures to burn down later... etc etc. It's not exclusive (although if you are shy it can feel like a bit of a hump to get over to get involved... I didn't feel ""cool enough"" to weld bikes till my senior year, but everyone was super welcoming when I started...)

A lot of Reedies seem destined for grad school, or like they know what they're doing, but everyone goes through a million incarnations of who they are and who they want to become. And while Reed has a lot of grads go on to grad school, tons of reedies find satisfying, exciting lives way away from academia or traditional careers. ",mimrm,2013-11-12 19:04:20
"&gt;Is there a scene for extracurricular art at Reed (student bands, etc.)? Can non-majors do theater (and do they)?

Music major here (if the name didn't give it away).  There are lots of people who play instruments on campus, so starting a band is literally as easy as sending out a message to student mailing lists that says you're looking for people to jam with.  There's also Jazz Ensemble, Chorus, Orchestra, and Collegium for credit/no credit options and private lessons (subsidized for music juniors and seniors).  As for theater, there are opportunities to be in productions like the directing scenes and thesis shows.  If you're into it, there's also WMD's fire shows.

&gt;Do you think that Reed is more fitted for students who have already determined that graduate school and whatever lies beyond is the path that they want to take?

Reed is not going to prepare you for a career.  Graduate school is a pretty good thing to do after your undergrad here because frankly your marketable skills once you leave are going to be somewhat underdeveloped if you don't spend the time sharpening them on your own.  What Reed *will* give you is a more critical view of the world and the ability to identify opportunities, flaws, and improvements that you can make to products and services.

this is also Reed, and you might run into a lot of metamorphosis stage hipsters.

this is also reed, and the motto is 'communism atheism and free love' you've got the owl, so you're gonna meet soem people that seem like they belong in the merry pranksters.

this is also reed, and you should be approaching a decision to go there based on whether or not you want to go to a school, that bucks the standard, and is proud of it, are you that way? do you want to go to a school that prides itself in an ability to immerse yourself in the capability of curiosity and critical cosmopolitan thinking? are these qualities you pride in yourself?

if yes, you will find people you like. if you're really more concerned about the people there, you probably won't fit in.",dvoge,2012-09-15 22:36:02
"'07 grad here. so, grain of salt: i haven't been a student in five years.

1) there are (were) some reedies who match the description you were given. there are also outgoing, extraverted gym rats, and all kinds of dots on the multi-axis scatterplot in between. most of the people you will meet at reed are really into whatever they study or what they're passionate about. personally, i think that is super hot. some folks are not so good at talking about anything else, but plenty of folks will be just as excited to talk to you about YOUR passions. visit and/or talk to some reedies. about something other than reed, even. i dated a bunch of awesome reedies while i was in college, and then i married a reedie. all my reedie friends are pretty awesome as well. i'm pretty sure i'm not just saying that 'cause i'm awkward and unattractive and don't know any better.

2) so, there is a stress culture at reed, for sure. people like to compete about how stressed out they are. they often exaggerate: ""i have to write six twenty-page papers by TOMORROW!"" the library late at night is kind of a social scene, especially during finals week. but i would not in general describe the academic atmosphere as competitive. no one gives a shit what anyone else's grades are. i didn't look at the letter grades for any of my classes until four years after i graduated. you know about how grades work at reed, right? here: http://www.reed.edu/academic/gbook/acad_pol/eval_student.html

i'm gonna level with you: chances are, if you're interested in reed and ""the academics and facilities at Reed seems too good to be true,"" you are a pretty accomplished high school student and you know how to get shit done. you will be fine at reed. there is a lot of work, yes, but i went to a lot of parties in college and i spent a lot of time, like, watching daria on youtube and hanging out with my cat (read: procrastinating like it was my job) when i should have been outlining papers, and i still got through with a nice B/B+ average (as it turns out) and the respect of my peers and professors. 

THAT SAID... to anyone who is considering reed: either someone will be spending a lot of money so you can go to reed, or you'll be taking out loans. school/life balance is important, but so is getting what your time and money are worth from the experience. i wish i had taken time off between high school and college, and i encourage anyone to consider it. i think i might have gained some perspective that i would have found useful in college.

3) i have never heard of or observed a particularly uneven balance. i think when i was there, it was like 51%/49% with more women. ",,2012-09-16 13:09:03
"Sophomore here so I'm still relatively inexperienced, but I think your points are pretty much all just exaggerations and/or jokes we make about ourselves. Awkward, introverted, people will be at every school you go to and I would say that maybe, just maybe, Reed actually has less of those people. The hygiene and unattractiveness is just flat out untrue. However, if you think women must shave all their hair or people have to wear store bought deodorant, you might be a little put off. On a scale of attractiveness though I would say Reedies are more attractive. Smarter, awesomely died hair, piercings, unique hairstyles are all the rage here in Portland and that makes it the sexiest city on the planet to me.

You can definitely have fun. Whoever said the workload is horrific is just lying to you. I'd say its the equivalent of working a full time job and maybe throwing in a few volunteer hours now and then. Parties happen pretty much every day of the week from Wednesday-Saturday and range from a chill get-together to an all out kegger.

Male/Female ratio is also not a problem, about a 55/45 split Female/Male. Also we're not stuck up bitches, we're down to get down, just like at any other school.

"Honestly, it doesn't sound like Reed is the right place for you. I went to Reed and although I loved it academically, I ended up transferring to a more traditional school.

Reed has weird people. Reed doesn't have the kind of parties you would expect a college to have. That's just a fact, and a lot of people come to Reed thinking that since it's college that just means they will automatically like it. It really doesn't work that way, and it sounds like you're already thinking it might not be your place. Seriously, if you have these questions already that's not a good sign.

Reed is a wonderful, wonderful place - but it is NOT a wonderful place for somebody who wants a traditional college experience.

"Hey, i am coming to reed next fall and was just wondering what you wish you had known before you came(this can be knowledge about anything ranging from reed workload, social life, or just life in general).  Congrats on finishing!!!",holyathiest,2012-05-13 13:48:13
"I wish I'd known:

-Some political and cultural views are just taboo at Reed.  Be careful what you say.  Many Reed community members aren't actually very open-minded.

-Don't be afraid to get to know strange people, and also don't be afraid to phase friends out of your life if you dislike like the way they make you feel.  Reed attracts all types, and you don't *have* to be friends with any particular person.

-The workload will just get very hard, to the point of severe emotional difficulty (at least for most).  Reed culture during my time didn't really permit me or my peers to acknowledge this head-on; rather, there's a stoic masochism that encourages us to brag about the workload.  Sometimes it can be helpful to look at yourself and admit: ""I'm working so hard that I'm losing my [friends/physical health/touch with my family].""  At that point, it might be time to lighten your workload, or take leave for a semester, or go travel.  Reed is a marathon, not a sprint.

-You'll probably fall in love during your time at Reed.  The community is tiny, and word gets around easily.  Messy breakups just make the gossip rounds quickly.  Be good to your significant other; do your best to avoid the crazy ones, and if the end looms, be sensitive and try to land softly.  By the time you graduate, it's entirely possible that people you don't even know will be able to name your exes and relate the way you treated them.

-Reed is, in some ways, the safest place I've ever known for experimenting with drugs.  However, the administrations' policies are changing, and the new President may be a bit of a hardass.  If you do decide to expand your mind (and I encourage you to do so), be discreet and mature.

-There is life off-campus.  Finding a group of like-minded students (I actually don't advise living with your best friends) to inhabit a Reed House is a great way to establish your own space and escape campus.",basquefire,2012-05-21 14:44:31

"I was there in 2006, and I also matriculated in 2007. I spent that year playing pool and rugby, reading comic books, and auditing a single course.

...I don't remember the commons turnstiles. I do remember when they put anti-scrounger gables on the counters, though. That segregated still makes me pretty sad.

Where are you headed now? I've fled Portland for the Northeast.",basquefire,2012-06-12 22:09:11
"Haha, oh, yes. I remember the gables too. Every year, they seemed to push scrounge further towards the doors. I missed the booths in the the front space which were open all night. I lived in Westport I as a freshman, and the booths and really bright light let me finish the Iliad for Hum.

There was a turnstile at the entrance next to ONE register (usually manned by George). Very few people remember this. People think I'm crazy when I go one about them. I do have two other Reedies and my sister on my side about it though. 

Imagine the fits people would be having now if they never expanded commons. 

The one thing I regret was never getting the code for MLLL. I would just pass by hoping someone was using it and use the room then. I think I applied to Reed because of their clubs, MLLL, and print-screening, and I never did any of these things. 

I'm stuck being depressed and shit down in lovely NC. I'm volunteering at my dad's office doing some boring medical dictations stuff and teaching his new hire basic computers. I'm missing Reed a lot (To think...and I had a mostly terrible time at Reed). I realized I'm starting to miss academics when I read an article about niacin from Physician's Desk Reference just to procrastinate. 

What are you doing in the NE? Anything good there? 

I'm going to try to get out of this rut and apply for some lab jobs, either back at OHSU or here in NC. Heh, I thought I hated Portland so much...and yet, I kind of want to go back. ",babyliongrassjelly,2012-06-12 22:21:52
"Oy, the scrounge... something tells me it'll be gone in a couple years. I'm sort of sick of watching Reed undergo this sterilization - although I also feel a need to fight an engagement with the Olde Reed mythos.

I remember those booths! They encouraged gossip far more than the current open plan does.

I ate my ""last"" meal in commons over the Reunion weekend. I tend to talk a lot of shit about Bon Apetit, but the truth is that it's head and shoulders above any other college cafeteria food I've eaten, including the Ivies.

I'm sad to hear you never engaged the MLLL.  It's a really tremendous resource, basically the only library of its kind I've ever heard of (a massive private collection open to unsupervised browsing).

I missed out on print screening, though. Apparnetly there's a screen which, instead of Communism-Atheism-Free Love, reads Liability-Liability-Liability. I want one of those pretty fucking bad.

I'm sorry you're depressed in NC, but for what it's worth the best friend I left behind in Portland (same major, etc.) is also getting depressed. I suspect it's lack of direction; I remember distinctly about a week before Renn Fayre I realized I was actually going to finish my thesis, and I panicked a little.  I didn't *want* to finish. Once I did, what on earth would I do? It was scary as hell.

Turns out I shouldn't have worried so much; this summer I'll be in NYC studying Yiddish. That'll be fun - and who knows? Anything can happen in Manhattan.

I may yet return to Portland in August. Unless something good comes up, that's my default plan. I just want to ride my bike up Tabor and see the city I never got to visit.",basquefire,2012-06-12 22:36:53
"Bon Appetit has definitely gotten better since freshman year. I still complained though. 

Aw, that shirt sounds awesome. 

For me, it was more like...""[Advisor], I don't think I'm going to get this done"". And falsely thinking my thesis was just some big lab report and that I could finish it as such. In the end, I don't think my thesis was something I was very proud of or cared about (not to mention, nothing worked). 

Thanks for the kind words. It's definitely part lack of direction, although I felt pretty lost even when my course load was strictly defined through my major requirements at Reed. 

Chinese AND Yiddish? That is awesome. 

This is OT, but since you're multilingual: What has been effective for you in learning languages? I am trying to get back into learning my mother-tongue. I learned the script (nowhere near as many as Chinese) through straight repetition, and it seemed to be okay, but my reading was always really slow. I can understand most of it with no need to ""translate"" most things into English, but I lack confidence in speaking. I stumble over very basic What helped you get that confidence?

How would you describe the workload of your specific thesis? What would you compare it to?,ProbablyRolling,2012-05-12 08:32:54
"First of all: I have no idea what the workloads of other theses are like.  There came a point about a month into fall semester when I and the other two Chinese majors realized we couldn't discuss our work with each other, because our topics were so specific.  In my case, there are only a few scholars in the world who have read the texts which are my primary sources.

So - I can't compare my thesis workload to those of others.  I can try to compare it to my own work, I suppose:

At least within the humanities, the thesis isn't the equivalent of a number of 10-12 page research papers strung together.  I didn't really see the overall shape of my thesis coming together until I was halfway through the third chapter (one month before Renn Fayre, really).  At that point, revision is necessary to mold the concepts into something which has some sort of narrative arc, and a lot of fat needs to be trimmed.

I would compare the most exciting moments in my thesis to the initial moment of research-paper writing when you stumble upon the perfect topic.  Finding gold material and knowing instantly that it's novel, even to your advisor, is a wonderful feeling.

The scariest moments can be compared to class-failing events.  For instance, realizing that a research lead I was tracking for a couple weeks was just useless and irrelevant lead me to delete dozens of pages, over the course of the entire process.  Each time I had to delete or throw away large chunks of work, it felt like I hadn't just written a shit paper for a class, but like I'd just learned I had actually not ever been registered for that class in the first place, and should have been in a different room all semester.  Deleting one's own words sucks hard.

The workload itself isn't really comparable to those of other classes - primarily because you write the thesis for yourself, and not for the sake of fulfilling an assignment.  Other papers are written in order to develop one's mechanical skills; the thesis is just on a different level.",basquefire,2012-05-13 11:29:16

* What was your thesis on?
* What are you going to do with your major?
* Are there any great 'secret' spots to study or read a book away from everyone else?",MooseBear,2012-05-12 17:37:42
"I wrote about a Chinese scholar's vision for national China in the early 20th century.  He wanted to deliberately synthesize Confucianism and Christianity into a value system which would serve as the political foundation for a modern country.

I really want to maintain my Chinese skills, so at some point I'll return to China for business or more language training.  But for now I'm going to go study Yiddish.

Away from everyone else?  Go to your room, shut the door, and put on headphones.  But honestly, the thesis desk helps put you in the zone because everyone around you is (or should be) suffering along with you.

As far as classes go, your adviser will probably recommend taking three (Hum, Math, and Science, perhaps). If you are considering being a physics major, take a fourth. I took three classes my freshman year and was bored out of my skull. Taking both Physics and Chemistry might be rough (especially if Nelia teaches Phys100) but you should do it anyways. You can always drop one if you think it will be too much.

Long story short: It probably won't kill you, but the alternative might be pretty boring.

Intro Science classes will probably be harder to handle in your sophomore year (especially if you plan on taking O-chem). Freshman year is the time to get those out of the way.

Most of the intro science classes (as a phys major, you'll take a few) are tought by more than one prof, and you dont get to pick, so thats a wash.  Same for Hum; you dont get a choice, but it usually turns out great.

PE is up to you, really. Reed has a ton of cool choices from sailing to Jiu Jitsu (my favorite). Find something that sounds cool and do it.  Word of advice: avoid anything involving swords unless you dont mind just tons of massive nerds.  I know thats pretty much inescapable at reed, but pick your battles.  Retro PE is great if you like old school playground games, so thats another popular choice.

"Regarding physics (I don't know anything about chem, unfortunately): The way it's set up is there is one prof that does the MWF lectures, and then you'll go to conference class a couple times a week with ~15 other students. Your prof for that will (usually) be someone else from within the physics department, and you don't get to choose when you sign up, but I definitely don't think that there's anyone you would want to avoid.

Nelia is teaching Phys100 lectures next year, which should be interesting because she's only been here for a couple years, so she hasn't taught that course at Reed before. She was a notoriously tough prof for her sophomore- and junior-level courses, but we all learned tons and came out as much stronger students than before, and I'm sure she will aim to not be too overwhelming for the intro class and will come up with some excellent topics to teach beyond the normal curriculum.

My experience with Reed math is that each professor has a distinct style, so you might find that some profs work better for you than others.

He invited the whole class over for a party ( Indian food cooked by himself, Youtube videos, music

If only Joel taught Phys 100 (there's no 101) again. I was lucky to have him as a sophomore and in Phys 200 computational methods lab! I was also really lucky to have David Griffiths as my conference prof one semester. Most people are not the biggest fans of the current (rotating?) Johnny Powell. I've only known him in one context, my thesis orals. He was a lovely person then. 

Chem 101-102 is a great intro course (I know you're a prospective physics major). I've taken all three intros (Bio, chem, physics), and Chem is the most well-rounded and one of the best thought out. It might only be beat by Joel's enthusiasm that one year (Dude had LaTeX'd lecture notes, conference papers, PS, all solution sets. He rehearsed every lecture We have some great professors (I was a Chem major). I would recommend intro Chemistry all the way. When I took it, I had Maggie and a visiting prof, and Arthur and Randy Hicks (now at Wheaton). Everyone's a de facto fan of Arthur, but I'm a little more neutral, since I've actually taken upper-level classes with him. Maggie is a really smart, strong professor, but I'm not her biggest fan. I don't know who is teaching next year. Julie Fry is the newest tenure-track environmental chem prof, coming back from her junior sabbatical this summer. She is an amazing person and professor, and she was extremely supportive of me when I was struggling at Reed. 

As for Physics, I've only taken the first two years. Year Two is very challenging. I had an extremely tough time, not at all helped by mental issues and illness. Nelia is crazy tough. She is also really seemingly unsympathetic, and, well, I don't know. She expects the best from everyone. She also thought teaching a class in binary (and making mistakes, and us getting the joke already) wouldn't make us want to rip off her head. (Yes, Nelia, we realize this is supposed to be your grand April Fool's joke. Please stop. No one's laughing). I see she's teaching 100 next year. Good luck.

Also, man, I really miss Randy. He was my favourite Chem professor. I remember the only morning freshman year I didn't make it to Hum lecture. I usually set my alarm clock to loud radio static, but it started picking up some sort of preacher fellow and I didn't wake up until halfway through a Chemistry exam. He let me finish the test in his office. Super good guy.",FrobozzMagic,2012-06-30 15:05:54

Randy is awesome! It's a shame he couldn't stay at Reed. He came back for Renn Fayre and the Intro Chem Demo this year though. He sort of remembered me, but I forgave it because it's been five years since I had him as a teacher. He was really nice about it. He was around for RF softball but he didn't help us play.

They actually just changed the number to 101, and changed a few of the physics course titles. Lame, I know. ""100"" always sounded much more respectable to me than ""101"", purely subjectively.",LeiaShadow,2012-06-13 01:38:32

"Aaaaah physics. Here's how its gonna go down for you guys next year.

Fall: Nelia Mann. Her problem sets are tough as balls, and make grown men cry. I've heard of people who finished her problem sets at 3 AM after working the entire day, and felt they had finished early. Last year, the multi professors had to ask her to make the problem sets easier, so people would actually do the multi problem sets. This is probably exaggeration, but nevertheless. It's not gonna be easy, but from what I hear she teaches pretty damn well. So thats nice. (note that all of this is stuff I've heard from the upperclassmen. I haven't taken a class with her... yet)

Now Spring semester is where it's gonna suck (in my opinion. Not everyone shares it). Because you'll have ol' Johnny Powell. Now here's the thing about Johnny. Johnny's a great guy. I enjoy talking to him one-on-one, and he's pretty good if you go to him outside of lecture and ask questions. If you are taking Physics to fill a group requirement, and nothing else, its great! But if you actually want to learn physics, well, no. Sure he kinda goes over the material, but he spend most of his lectures going off on tangents about biophysics, which, while mildly interesting, isn't what I signed up for. Also birds. Lots of birds. Also his problem sets are, in my opinion, just plain dumb. Not hard, just busywork. So if you have any background in physics at all (which I'm guessing you do), spring semester is gonna be more about your other classes. 

Dont worry though, I've heard from physics majors that Physics 200 is great. I know I'm looking forward to it. Also on the subjects of other classes to take - Math 121 (Intro Computing) and 384 (programming language design)/382 (algorithms), taught by Jim Fix. Just the goddamn best classes ever. Its just.... so great. 384 is probably the best course I've taken so far. Seriously. Take 121. If you are gonna be a physics major, you'll probably take Hum, Physics 101, and (maybe, you can ask to skip out of it. I would honestly recommend it. Reed math is famously...interesting. Not very useful from a application perspective) Math 111. So you have 1 or 2 spots free. If you get out of calc, I would start on the group reqs ASAP so that you can take a better selection of the cool physics electives. You might even want to ask about starting multi in your first semester. I've heard that people have done that - I eternally regret not asking if it was gonna be possible.

As far as Hum 110 conference leaders, I would recommend taking Jan Mieszkowski's conference. That guy is just the best. At least this year it was the MW 3-4:30 conference, which *should* stay the same. I'll ask him about that.",melkorthefoul,2012-05-08 18:45:21
"Sweet, thanks for the advice! I took the most boring comp sci class in existence this year and would love to take one where the teacher actually acted like he wanted to be there. I asked ian fisher about testing out of calc, and he said no because Reed's math is... different.... so calculus for me! 

I'm thinking about an art or an art history class to fill the extra space... but probably won't take five classes right off the bat. ",squidgirl1,2012-05-08 20:23:50
"Nevertheless, during O-Week, after you talk with your adviser I would recommend going to the math department meeting (should be listed somewhere on the schedule) and ask about it. That is, unless, you want to take calc, which is fine. Just that if you've taken basic integral/differential calc... you'll probably be bored. 

Jim is wonderful. He'll ramble on a bit about the lambda calculus in 121 (or he might not, he hinted that he teaches his classes a little differently each year), which won't make any sense unless you take 384, but its a cool class. Also not particularly hard, if you can think logically. 

I highly doubt you can take 5 classes in any case! I dont think freshmen are allowed to overload fall semester (and you need a decent GPA, or lacking that, a very convincing argument to overload any other semester. But it does depend on the adviser), so 4 classes. I would not recommend taking less. You'll feel bored, and probably regret not spreading your courseload out when you are a junior. 

Also I asked Jan, its probably conference 23, a cryptic piece of information which will make more sense when you register for classes. ",melkorthefoul,2012-05-08 23:37:38

If you are looking to attend Reed for drugs then you are looking for the wrong reason.,Scoldering,2012-04-18 12:44:45
"There is some degree of leniency with drugs/alcohol on campus, but I don't think it's as free as everyone thinks. In general, if you put in some effort into keeping these activities private, then I don't think you're going to get hassled too much. If you're rolling hard and being a dick in public, or selling hard drugs to people on campus, chances are you're gonna get in trouble.

"Reed's pretty special in that regular AOD violations are handled stricly on campus--no police involvement. You get one chance which is pretty much just a warning. A second violation involves meeting with your RD, who will probably tell you something like ""I won't tell you to stop smoking, but you have to understand why we're enforcing these policies."" This should lead into a discussion about the honor principle, which would continue if you were to receive a third AOD, which calls for a meeting with either Mike Brody (Dean of Student Services) or Bruce Smith (Associate Dean of Students). These conversations could be some of the best you'll have about the AOD policy, since you're talking directly with administration in a confidential environment. I was certainly surprised by some of what Bruce had to say, and he was really grateful to me for expressing my opinions and reflections honestly. 

Four AODs is when things start to get less pleasant, though ._. That pretty much gives one of administration grounds to pursue an honor case against you. I haven't had an honor case myself, but [here's the website that explains everything.](http://www.reed.edu/honor_principle/process.html)

So, yeah, you could say we're ""lenient,"" but I think that gives a false sense of complacence. You could say we're more rational and fair than other schools who might resort to authoritarian measures like arrests and expulsions.",weediereedie,2012-04-19 12:58:22

"If you go on the Quest Facebook page, you can see some  revisions to the AOD policy proposed by Senate. It's not Olde Reed, but it's not ""conservative and punishing."" For example, the revisions call for an ""AOD Panel"" after four violations to review incident reports against written student responses to those reports. Under the current policy, however, four AOD violations lead to an Honor Case. Another addition I like is the announcement of a full list of what the College deems ""hard drugs.""

We can't be sure that the changes will be approved, but I think they're fair and rational enough that the administration will accept them (I know Bruce Smith was working closely with students on this project).",weediereedie,2012-04-30 11:19:24

"I went in to Reed thinking that I was going to do the 3-2 program with columbia. Let me tell you, it kicked my ass. I believe that eligibility for the program depends on a 3.5 gpa, a tough feat at Reed, compound that with the accelerated track that you are put on, and it seemed to be just too stressful(even for Reed). Additionally, I felt like the program attempted to push the students through Reed to quickly and there was no time to explore interests in other classes, and take optional classes in the major. I am now a straight chem major and still feel pressed for time, but I am now afforded much more room in terms of classes in my major that I can take that expand upon my major interests. 

If you still have a passion for engineering I suggest looking at one of the sciences, physics in particular and major in that. After Reed go for your masters or a second bachelors and it will be more of a 4-2. A recent graduate and good friend of mine majored in history and now pursues mechanical engineering for a second bachelors. He is expected to graduate in two years. Good luck with what ever you decide to do.  ",aggsquirrel,2012-01-14 00:10:35

Same things that are true about the rest of Reed are true in physics: small classes, great profs, and so on. The professors are pretty evenly divided between theorists and experimentalists, so you can easily do a good thesis on either side of that line. Mine was part experiment and part computation.

Physics 100 is your run-of-the-mill introductory survey course. 200 is also a survey course, but with introductions to deeper and more interesting topics. Starting in your junior year, you'll take semester-long courses in more focused topics -- Classical Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Thermal Physics, and so on -- plus electives like Scientific Computation (&lt;3), Optics, and Solid-State Physics.


In case you're interested, I can also answer questions about [the reactor](http://reactor.reed.edu), which wasn't technically part of my physics education, but certainly had something to do with my knowledge of physics.",etaoin,2012-01-15 22:34:17

"Well from everything I've read (and I've read as much as I can get my hands on...I often get obsessive about things, and Reed has become one of those things. When I came to America a few months ago to visit my SO in Seattle, we took a train down to Portland for the day so I could visit  Reed's campus and have a tour and an interview. I picked up the catalog and some other materials, and I also purchased a book ""Colleges That Change Lives"" by Loren Pope, just because it had a small section on Reed in it. I should probably get on with it and close the parenthesis.), Reed sounds like exactly the right place for someone like me. 

I say this because it is apparently ""the most intellectual college"" in the USA according to various sources, and there is a constant buzz of intelligent discussion. I think that I have both the ability and the passion (especially the passion) to contribute to these sorts of discussions regularly, and in doing so, I would hope that others can net some sort of benefit from it, just as I find that the challenge of others benefits me. It's nice to be a big fish in a small pond, or an intelligent person in a sea of people who don't challenge you in that way (not to imply that they would have nothing to teach you...I think that everybody has something to teach somebody else...but I don't want to have another massive digression, so, period.). But I would rather be challenged by people greater than myself, because this is what makes people great...rising to the challenge of other, greater people. And from what I've read, Reed is the place to find such people. I feel like an arrogant asshat at the moment...but really all it is is me loving to have logical arguments with people, and me finding self improvement through such arguments.

But as well as this, Reed is also a place where the students work their asses off, if I've got it correct. In a place with so many intelligent people, it's unavoidable, you can't slack off. And given all the discussion that takes place around the class materials (I have been told this is especially true of Humanities 110 since everyone has to take it), you wouldn't want to slack off or you'd miss out on everything. In junior high, I basically got by having never done any work. I got on the honour roll and I never did anything. So by the time high school rolled around, I lacked a sense of work ethic, and my failings somewhat destroyed my self esteem and ruined me for a little while. I don't think this has been an entirely bad thing...I've got some valuable life experience out of it in fact (essentially I learned not to be an arrogant dickhead, and to live with myself in lieu of the approval of others, particularly my family)...but I still feel that my procrastination has kept me from being able to reach my full academic and intellectual potential, and I think Reed is exactly the place that would give me passion and tasks I actually want to work on, and that at Reed I'll be able to find joy in working and thinking together (instead of thinking about the world being something I do as a full-time hobby like it is now). 

Something that also appeals to me that I actually hadn't really thought about in a lot of depth, and that is slightly different to the intellectual vibrancy of the school, is the character that I think it has. Reed apparently takes academic risks when it is making admission decisions,  risks like me. It makes me feel as though Reed College wants people like me to go there, and knows how to help people like me be successful. Because, for all intents and purposes, at this moment I'm not very successful. I find it difficult to explain in much further detail what I mean by 'character'...but I get the feeling that the faculty and other staff are great people, both from what I was able to experience on my campus tour and interview, and what I've read about the nature and style of the college.

Ah...yeah. Hopefully I've actually managed to say something meaningful in this wordy mess of (probably) half-baked ideas. Reed shall be my oven, however! (I hope).

That said, there are more students now than there were even in 2004 when I was a freshman, and I think the trampling of the ducks went down in 2003 and by that point Glo Opera in the amphitheater was an exercise in getting everyone as tightly packed in as you could and everyone sweating out their coming up together. It'd have to be real orderly-like, but you'd be able to assure with the amphitheater that if you're in the bowl everyone could see and hear, which is somewhat of an issue on that lawn.",Scoldering,2011-09-06 10:29:37

"First, congratulations on getting in!

I haven't personally taken comp sci classes, but I've taken the first two years of the standard math (minus linear algebra). Unfortunately, the teacher I had last year for both terms just retired, so while I had an excellent experience with him, it isn't that relevant.

This year I've had Tom Wieting both terms. Students seems to have mixed opinions about him, but despite this I've thoroughly enjoyed his course.

If possible, I'd recommend trying to visit Reed, and sit-in on a course. As a student, I tend to do well in math regardless of the environment, and I've only had one math course I disliked (at a community college, so not reed), so I might be a bit biased.

I can say that at our weeklyath colloquium we just had a jobs panel, where 4 alumni from the math department and 1 person from OHSU (a nearby research hospital) came to do a Q&amp;A about careers in math. The four alumni seemed to all have jobs in computer science despite having math degrees (they graduated before math with comp sci concentration was a degree choice), and one graduated within the past 5 years. While I didnt take notes, my take-away from it was that in industry, it's more important to have good experience trying to solve problems than it is having prior experience on a specific coding language.

Besides the math part though, I've really enjoyed my time at Reed. As it sounds like its significantly more expensive for you, that'll definitely have to factor into things, but I'm very glad I attended Reed over my local state school (Oregon State University if you're curious). While Berkley is likely very different from OSU, I've seen the rigor of classes at OSU, and know that I would uave been very bored/unsatisfied there.

If you have any other questions, I can try to answer them. Again, I am so far more of math/physics than math/comp sco, so I'll likely not be useful for your questions about comp sci.",orangejake,2015-03-28 15:30:44
"Thanks for the response! I'll be doing an overnight stay in mid-April, so I'll get a very good idea of the school.

A few questions:

- What is the standard format for math courses? Conference style, lecture, other?

- Is there a lot of collaboration between students in the math dept?

- And a totally different question: What is the party scene like? I am not that into big ragers, more into lengthy, intelligent, well-informed discussions that are accompanied by an altered mind-state.

Thanks again.",daster714,2015-03-28 16:53:21
"Math courses are traditionally lecture, although with small class sizes (around 15 is typical). All profs I've had have been very good with taking questions during lecture, and with having office hours available for further questions. Theres also drop in tutoring avaliable each weeknight.

There can be a decent amount of collaboration. My floor (by chance, not by being a theme dorm) has a lot of math/physics people hang out in our common room, so ""collaboration"" (meaning discussing problem sets/topics in math) happens frequently. This is very likely atypical of most common rooms, but I could imagine other groups like it existing on campus.

I'm personally sub free, so I don't know a ton about the party scene, but what youve described sounds like something you could find if you want.

Another thing I should mention is that this subreddit is pretty inactive most times. Posting on the 2019 facebook page might get you a lot larger of a response",orangejake,2015-03-28 17:35:31
"The math courses I've taken have been lecture-style, and small, allowing for questions mid-lecture. 

There is a ton of collaboration! We formed a regular group that met once weekly for multi I, stuff like that happen all the time. 

The party scene at Reed mostly consists of what we call ""balls,"" or dance parties in the SU. (Daft ball, Beyoncé ball, LCD sound system ball, etc) Dive into the middle and jump up and down for four hours, chill outside with the chillers on the SU porch, or huddle in a cozy dorm room with some friends talking about stuff - whether you do this sober or mind-altered, you'll pretty easily find people to do it with you. There's a gradient of party and I've very very rarely (like, once) felt pressured to ""go hard"" or whatever. 

House parties are also good for casual co-mingling, but those are usually atmospheres for weed and/or alcohol, if you're looking for a more cosmic experience. ",ecoevodevo,2015-03-29 10:40:36
"I've taken Jim Fix's intro CS, and it was stellar. Like everything else at reed, very theory-based. I would recommend posting to the FB group for your year for more advice - we have a new CS prof that I don't know, and are hiring a computational biologist next year (eee!) 

Joel Franklin's scientific computation, I've heard, will kick your butt but is incredibly worthwhile, if you're into that kinda stuff. ",ecoevodevo,2015-03-29 10:43:36
"I got accepted and I doubt I'll be getting any financial aid either. Currently it's between Reed and Grinnell, which is offering me a pretty sweet aid package which puts the total cost in the UC range. I still haven't gotten how much I'm going to get at Reed, since I haven't gotten the envelope yet. Grinnell has about 3 times as much money as Reed, which is probably why I got so much aid, but it's in the middle of Nowhere, Iowa. 

What's reeling through my head is how much the difference between the schools is going to cost me. I would like to be a neuroscientist at a top tier research institution like Stanford or UCSD. Grinnell is a liberal arts school with strong sciences and adequate rigor, although probably not as much rigor as Reed. They also both have strong opportunities for undergraduate research, although Grinnell doesn't offer a year long thesis. But Grinnell does have a dedicated neuroscience class with the neuroscience professors to go along with it, even if they only have one neuroscience class. But it's also in the middle of Nowhere, Iowa. But they also have this massive endowment, meaning it probably won't be that hard to get funding for a project and they probably have some very nice facilities. Although I don't think they have anything like Hum 110, which I kinda want to try. I've already visited Reed and loved it, so I'm going to visit Grinnell over the break.

So once I get a clear picture of the differences between the two colleges and the aid offer from Reed, I'm going to compare the total cost difference to the differences between the two colleges. If Grinnell is on par or better than Reed and it costs me $90,000 more to go to Reed, than I will probably go to Grinnell. If it turns out that Grinnell is a terrible place to be, and it costs me $40,000 more to go to Reed, meaning I will go into debt, I will probably go to Reed. How much should I pay per year to not be stuck in the middle of cornfields? How much is a thesis opportunity worth? If the mindset at Grinnell is different, how much should I pay to be surrounded by the people of Reed as opposed to the people at Grinnell? 

Of course, you are comparing a public university to Reed, so you have to factor in how much smaller class sizes benefit you and other differences between a public university and Reed concerning your own hopes and aspirations.

I keep on thinking about the unknown differences between the two lives I could live at these schools. I decided to go a private high school instead of the public high school of my area. I've been doing things that my 8th grade self couldn't have imagined. It's partly because of the resources at the private school. I got interested in science (again) because us Honors Biology students had to participate in a science fair. I learned about Reed from one of the college counselors. I gave up playing the violin because the school didn't have a string orchestra. There was also an added pressure to do well since my family was paying for it.

What freaks me out is how small, seemingly insignificant events had enormous ramifications. If I hadn't bombed that English paper on comparing Robert Frost with Tupac, I wouldn't have to take a normal English class as opposed to the Honors course, meaning I wouldn't have had to save face because of my immature freshman idea of appearing smart, meaning I wouldn't have applied to Honors Biology, meaning I wouldn't have gotten interested in scientific research, meaning I wouldn't have applied to Reed or Grinnell. I wouldn't have been friends with the people crazy enough to take Honors Biology. I wouldn't be viewing the world through the lens of science. I'd probably go the traditional route of college application preparation, which meant doing hours of community service, being the president of various clubs and the class council, and applying to all eight ivies along with Stanford and a couple of UCs. 

Which sorta freaks me out because if small events can cause that much of a difference, then something like this would be **insane**. [What sort of hurricanes am I going to cause by choosing either school?](http://www.viruscomix.com/page556.html).  What if the fact that I'm in debt means that I won't get that coffee meaning I won't meet that maniac pixie dream girl? Or what if having that extra money means that I'm going to be robbed at gunpoint and killed on my way back from the opera? What friendships and relationships will I never have? What people will I never meet? What ideas will I never encounter? I feel like I'm killing a person by choosing one over the other. 

Anyway, that's my thought process. Watch the movie [Mr. Nobody (2009)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/) to get another idea of what I'm thinking. Don't watch the director's cut; it's like he pissed all over the original movie. ",Lankonk,2015-03-29 21:57:04
"Reed vs Grinnell does seem like a difficult choice. I only really have two serious options: UC Santa Cruz and Reed. I really wasn't expecting to get into Reed, so I was pretty comfortable with UCSC. Now that I have the option it's almost certainly Reed.

My ""dream"" currently would be teaching computer science at a top tier university while also doing AI research. Secondary to that, working at Google, Quora, or some really cool tech company as a software engineer. Reed is better, undoubtedly, for going on to grad school. Santa cruz is also good for grad school, being a UC. It also has close ties to silicon valley. Surrounding wise, they are both beautiful schools.

The culture and rigor is also really important. Reed is far more rigorous, and well-respected. It also has a culture that, as a Berkeley born atheist and socialist, fits me like a glove. I have always gone to small schools, so I think Reed is a better fit in that regard. I've heard people say it starts to feel too small, but I don't think I'll have that issue. Especially since almost everyone at Reed is probably super smart and interesting; whereas a big public school like Santa Cruz would have a lot more uninteresting, not-dedicated people.

It is very strange how small choices can have dramatic impact on one's life. The college we choose will change everything from our friends, ideas and aspirations to our lovers, residence, and workplace. It is a massive choice, and not something I plan to take lightly. Honestly though, I am hard-pressed to find negative things to say about Reed, maybe someone can help me out?

Money is a thing, but I am thinking more and more that Reed is worth it. It should definitely not, at least in my situation, be a deciding factor. ",daster714,2015-03-29 23:25:14

"Quals cover intro to real analysis, linear algebra, and multi. I'm taking multi now, so I can't speak for upper division courses or linear, but hours are fairly manageable. I have 3 classes per week (most math classes are 4 though), and around 3-6 hours of homework weekly. There's also a weekly math colloquium, where either a visiting professor, or one of the faculty present some math concept (sometimes it can be really confusing: today was about the genus pullback method of calculating seigal modular forms, I didn't really follow most of it, but some are really cool like showing the proof of monsky's theorem). 

I can't really make it to the thesis tower tomorrow, but in the talk about seigal modular forms Jerry (one of the math faculty) suggested that improving the algorithm to calculate them could be a thesis (this might sound simplistic, but they are INSANE so it actually sounds like it'd be way too difficult). If you pm me Saturday I could head up to the thesis tower and look at some for you.

Edit: it's good to have a focus (I think I'm going to math Major too), but make sure to keep yourself open to everything. My roommate wants to do biochem, but actually really loves the required humanities course, so I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up being an English major.

"My specific math class is 3 to 6 hours weekly. My Hum class is usually an hour or two of reading 3x a week, plus any essay related work (usually 6 to 10 hours each 3 or 4 weeks). Physics is usually 1 or 2 hours 3 times per week. 

Math 211 has people who either took calc in high school, then Reed's intro to real analysis class (Math 112), or just took 111 and 112. One of my friends in 111 had no calc background before, and a relatively weak algebra background, and while she's not excelling, she's staying afloat. 

Honestly, as someone who likes math so far Reed's math courses are interesting, and fairly easy. I'm likely not that indicative of the norm with regard to math though, but essentially math at Reed is fairly heavy on justification: calculating the answer isn't good enough, you need to explicitly justify what you're doing (my prof wants us to write out a paragraph in English explaining what we plan on doing).

"As a sophomore math major, I feel confident telling you that no matter your math preparation before Reed there will be times when the work load is overwhelming. The actual hours required depend on the class and the professor. I spent maybe 3hrs a week on 111 and 112 but in Multivariable this year I can easily spend 10hrs looking up theorems, talking to other students, going to office hours if the problem set is especially complicated.  Once again, it really depends on the professor and their philosophy toward teaching. I have friends in other classes that don't spend as much time on their work.

I don't know a lot of theses but there's generally a large range of topics from statistical analysis to folding algorithms. Theses are listed on the Reed mathematics department website.

Not going to lie, the qual scares me, but from what I have been told it should only be a little worrying. The qual isn't supposed to be something you fail; if your professors think you will your advisor will tell you.

"&gt; Are my parents in the right with their concern about the rigor?

I don't know. Did they go to Reed? I'm assuming they didn't. Seems as though they're basing their concern off of the way you've handled stress and work in high school so far. If so they probably have a decent read on your inclination towards anxiety. 

Is Reed monstrously difficult? No. So hard you'll lose all joie de vivre? No. Can it beat you up? Yes - but the only pertinent factor in your continued success is your ability to roll with the punches. Reed can't drag you down unless you let it. 

&gt; but I think that no matter where I go, the college workload is going to be more challenging than high school, and I will have to adapt, which is frightening, but unavoidable (I think).

don't be so scared! college is difficult, moreso than high school, but its certainly nothing to be frightened about. wherever you end up going i'm sure you'll be able to cope with the work asked of you so long as you keep a balanced attitude. in my experience, it was never the actual difficulty or volume of the work that caused attrition - it was the (lack of) emotional stability and psychological factors that were allowed to dominated. 


&gt; Is the fear of ""burning out"" after graduation legitimate?

I really don't follow this argument. I think you should press your parents on their grounding with this one. Remind them that anecdotal evidence in the form of two of 'unsuccessful' alumni does not thereby make an argument or prove a point. 

A very high percentage of Reed students go on to graduate programs. One of the highest in the country in fact. I'm sure you've seen that bandied about somewhere. Where does this slot in with their observations? 

However, since you asked - anecdotally, no one I know of who graduated from Reed has been so kicked in the ass by the workload that they write their whole life off as a wash after they graduate. I mean thats just really silly. Most who are interested in continued study go off to equally rigorous (if not more so) programs. 
 

&gt;How competitive are students among each other at Reed compared to other respected Liberal Arts schools such as Swarthmore or Bard?

I didn't go to either Swarthmore or Bard so I couldn't tell you, but my experience with the competitive side of reedies was very minimal. Grades are neither regularly handed out nor discussed much. Amount of time spent in the library is the only somewhat competitive aspect of campus life, but at that its minimal and easy enough to avoid. 

&gt; Is Reed much more challenging than other private liberal arts colleges?

Again, only went to one college, but based on some of my friends who went elsewhere, i'd say theres certainly more of a culture of academia taken seriously at Reed. That being said, its not categorically distinct from other liberal arts schools, it just tends more towards being more persnickety and intellectual and 'life of the mind esque' (ugh) than other schools. 


&gt; Would spending the money to fly to Portland and tour Reed before applying be enlightening or beneficial?

Of course. If you're serious about going to Reed you should certainly (read definitely) come visit. Sit in on a few classes, walk around, think about whether you want to spend four years there. I would be very hesitant to recommend Reed to anyone who hasn't visited it themselves. ",daloc22,2014-07-29 17:21:10

"It's difficult to compare rigor with other schools unless there's some transfer students lurking about. Reed is a challenging school, but there is room for you to take a larger/smaller course load as fits your needs. If you're doing well right now, I wouldn't expect you to have trouble.

In general I think that if you look at Reed's description, think ""this sounds good,"" and you get admitted, then you belong here.",Zeplar,2014-07-29 16:28:40
"Yes. No. No. Yes. Reed is very difficult and from what everyone that went to other schools tells me, Reed is much harder than most if not all schools. It will be much harder than your high school experience. However, Reed is a great place to study and the school equips you with all the tools you will need to succeed. Fear of burning out afterwards is highly unlikely and a few people I know that graduated this year, have jobs making $80K+ lined up. Students are not competitive with each other, but are competitive with the curriculum. The Reed student body is like one big fraternity, we are all there for each other.

Math at Reed is, in general, pretty abstract. As a transfer student you'd still have to take Hum 110, the year-long intro humanities class, which is awesome. You'd probably end up graduating in four and a half years, including your time at UCLA, if you transfer starting as a junior. I haven't met a transfer student that's graduated without taking an extra semester. 

Hum 110 will be the largest class you take. The largest math class  I've had has been ~25 people, not counting Jim Fix's intro computing with ~40/lecture or so. It's a popular class, Jim is awesome and his intro class is practically a requirement for a reed education in a STEM subject. 

You get a ton of opportunities to engage with the professor, from asking questions in class (please don't do this in hum) to going to weekly or biweekly office hours. 

Reed is hard. If you're struggling at UCLA, well, I might not recommend it. If you're just doing okay, I could see you coming to Reed and doing okay if you take advantage of free tutoring and professor office hours. But, then again, I've only ever experienced Reed, and there might be another reedittor who's a transfer student who will have a better insight as to comparative difficulty. 

Edit: you'll be able to express yourself without being belittled as long as you don't ooze privilege, some people can be a little jumpy with their privilege discourse. But yeah, the general consensus is ""fuck yeah math majors"" in the sense of ""fuck yeah pursuing your academic passion"" 

Double edit as I reread your post and see what I forgot: 
Grades are un-emphasized at Reed. You get graded on things, but you have to specifically request to see your grades. Exams are totally up to the professor, I have a course with three midterms right now and three problem sets a week, and a course with one problem set a week and no exams other than the final. Pretty much do the work that's given to you and try your best to understand it, asking questions if you don't.

"Thanks for the informative answer. I am struggling a bit at UCLA, but at the same time not really because I don't really go to Office hours, and I've sort of stopped going to lecture. Its not because I feel I know more than the professors or anything, but I just feel like I'm wasting time being in lecture because the way the professors are teaching the material just isn't working for me. The only class I've attended lecture all the time for is my Math class because my professor actually shows why it works and he works out problems and interprets the implications of certain mathematical techniques. 

In all honesty, I feel like being in UCLA is like being in high school again, I'm just given information and expected to accept it as fact. For example, I'm currently taking a Physics class in oscillations, electricity, magnetism, etc and my professor doesn't explain how to do any of the problems or the physical intuition behind of the concepts, he literally has a powerpoint that touches on few points of a topic and gives you the necessary equations. These powerpoint slides do not show any of the reasoning behind the concepts or at least a derivation of how certain equations came to be. So my Physics lecture consists of me hearing my professor read the powerpoint and if I get lucky, maybe he'll do part of ONE problem.

Let me know if I'm just being a baby, but I just felt college would be more about discovery. I was expecting to see Professors passionate about their damn subject and was hoping to be able to question why things work and get a valid or reasonable answer. In the end, the reason I'm doing okay in classes is because I'm looking through various online material, and textbooks that help me understand my college material. I'm willing to put in as much work as I can, but if I'm just teaching all of this material to myself, then why the hell am I putting myself in debt by being in this school to learn material I could have learned on my own.

It's actually why I'm dropping multivariable calc II next semester, because the arduous proofs behind the theorems totally fail to grab my attention, haha. I need something like physics to sink my teeth into. 

Physics here is great. (So is math, don't get me wrong, just not for me.) Johnny Powell teaches E&amp;M, and his ""joke final"" that got emailed around last year went something like ""starting with 1+1=2, derive Einstein's theory of general relativity."" While that may be a hyperbole, his class and the class I'm in now is all about building up from core concepts and making sure you understand how you derive the equations you're using.

"As somebody who transferred in as a junior math major, I think I can answer some of these questions.

At Reed the emphasis is much more on knowledge and understanding then on monetary interests. This is lovely while you're here, but at the same time I do feel like I need to start figuring out what my plan is for after Reed since I only have 1 semester left.

I can tell you that there is no emphasis on sports, Greek life and people tend to mostly do extracurricular stuff that interests them, but it doesn't seem defining for people here. As a fairly awkward person myself, I will warn you that making friends can be difficult here. Portland has a reputation for not being a friendly place and I don't think Reed is different. It's not that people are mean, it's just that they usually seem indifferent. People just don't do stuff like say, ""Hey, this thing is going on later that you might enjoy, you should show up"", in my experience. As a result, I found it difficult to make friends. That was a bit of a culture shock since I wasn't expecting it.

Class sizes are about ~20 people in the math department in my experience, sometimes more. I think I've seen it as high as 28 and as low as 6 within the department.

People definitely talk about life and academics. There seems to be a mixture of open-mindedness and hostility. Reed has a sort of, ""you do what you want"" type of atmosphere, which means you sometimes see very vocal criticism of other viewpoints.

Drugs are definitely accepted as part of Reed College. As somebody who doesn't use drugs, I definitely felt at times that they were prominent enough to be disruptive to trying to make connections with people. It's hard when you try to hang out with people, then they all decide they want to go smoke pot and you don't want to. You might have an easier time making friends than I did.

All in all, Reed sounds like it would be a good cultural fit for you. That being said, the acceptance rate for transfer students is something like 25%, so if you're unhappy with UCLA I would recommend looking into some other schools as well. If you're serious about transferring, you should use your winter break to do applications. If I recall correctly, deadlines are in March, so you should get started soon.

Finally, I transferred in as a Junior and I will be graduating without taking an extra semester. However, almost all my classes transferred and I had taken a class that gave me credit for Hum 110. ",,2013-12-13 23:09:51

"This is right on the money.

I never saw heroin, and I never heard of it being used (or even available), outside of the two overdoses, which, besides being heavily publicized, were heavily, heavily politicized as well. The most prevalent drug is definitely alcohol, followed fairly closely by weed. Hallucinogens are used by many Reedies at least once, and by others fairly frequently. Molly/MDMA is fairly popular as well, and I was aware of some people doing cocaine, though that wasn't very prevalent, in my experience, and it did seem like most of those who did use it, didn't do so all that frequently.

RKSK was mostly satirical, or about getting people drunk/having fun. The rest of the political groups didn't seem too active. The Blue Heron Infoshop, as far as I understood it, was a sort of anarchist group, but I didn't pay them much attention; they did seem to have a devoted, if small, membership. Most Reedies tend to be too busy with their work to get too heavily involved in Political groups/activism.

On the job question. I'd say it depends entirely on what you study, and what you plan to do out of school. If you study one of the sciences, especially, and plan on going to grad school for that later, then you have a pretty solid chance of getting a job in a lab somewhere, as long as you plan ahead and don't wait till the last second to look for one. I know of a fair number of people have gotten jobs in University labs and whatnot. It helps a lot to talk with your professors, because odds are they have a colleague somewhere who will be hiring. It also definitely helps to do internships over the summers. If you decide not to stay in your field, job opportunities are going to be a bit more limited in some respects, because you may not have applicable skills, though you can apply to a wide variety of jobs. But then, it also depends on the sorts of jobs you're looking for or applying to. The job market varies pretty greatly city to city, so it can be a bit of a crap shoot. My biggest advice is just to start applying early, or it's going to be a giant pain in the ass, and you'll end up living with your parents while you job hunt, which I can tell you from personal experience, is not that fun.

Make sure you visit, preferably for multiple days, or multiple times. I'd aim for sometime later in the semester, so you can see how busy/stressed people get. Attend a class or two in a field you're interested in. If the weather is nice, don't expect that to be the norm.

As for the architecture question, I'm not sure I know how to answer, and I certainly don't know enough about architecture to answer if I did. Of course, I love the architecture on campus (for the most part) and wouldn't change it. The most unifying feature of Reed's culture is that everybody is a nerd about something. Everybody is interested in what you're studying, doing, writing your thesis or paper on, to one degree or another. Tons of intellectual curiosity. That said, social groups can be a bit rigid at times and I saw many friend groups fracture pretty substantially over the years, though I'm sure that applies to every college in one way or another.",reckless7,2013-10-27 12:51:57

This season begins around the start of May and lasts until about the end of September. The other season does not have a name.

"I. In the late 2000s when I attended, there was a presence of heroin on campus. I was close friends with one user, and personally met about 8 others over the course of four years. I never met either of the students who overdosed, so it is likely that there were more whom I did not know about. Interestingly, none of the people who I knew who did heroin did it with each other. Opiate addicts at Reed tend to be isolated and far less social than standard drug users.

That said, 8/1300 is a really small number, and my experience was half a decade ago. It may have changed since then. On the other hand, it could be that users are even more isolated and secretive now than before because of the stigma that happened in the wake of the overdoses.

II. There is a presence of leftist and anarchist activism at Reed. The majority of students are too busy to participate, but if that's your thing you'll find a robust and welcoming community. Portland is a hotbed for anarchist activism as well.

RKSK is a blast, I highly recommend getting naked and setting things on fire as often as possible.

"At the risk of repeating what other people have said:

I've never heard of anyone using heroin in the three years I've been here, though I've heard of/witnessed people using a very colorful variety of milder drugs.

In regards to political activity, Reedies tend to be very left-leaning, but most of them get too wrapped up in their own work to be very politically active. The reality is that after freshman year, your coursework will consume most of your life and you will have to be very careful with how you spend your remaining time and energy.

Financial aid is unlikely to grow in the foreseeable future, but it is currently very good.

My honest answer is that unless you are planning a career in academia, Reed is not the place to go if you want it to be easy to get a job after graduation. If you want to waltz into a good job at the end of four years of undergraduate college, then find a in-demand job in technology or health care and study it at a larger university. What Reed will offer you is the critical thinking skills to adapt to a wide variety of circumstances, and the academic skills necessary to excel in an advanced degree program that will get you a job (which is why 70%+ Reed graduates end up going to grad school).

To be perfectly honest, I think the architecture style on campus DOES describe the culture at Reed.

we have one computer scientist total, and while he is very good (and offers a plenty large selection of curricula), it's not exactly the program that one would expect from a big university; for instance, to study solely computer science here one would need to be a math major, which requires you to take math courses you wouldn't need to take elsewhere.

for comparison, at university of washington the math requirement for a CS degree is pretty much calc 1-3 and linear algebra, which is far less than what is required of you here

however, this is NOT to discourage you from coming here; i'm a math major. i'm just saying if computer science is your jam, find out if the program here is right for you. taking a bunch of higher level math classes during one's undergraduate years is probably very beneficial to the computer scientist

Its actually work noting that, while new undergrads dying of alcohol poisoning or related accidents, Reed doesnt even have that problem.

Being a good student employee at Reed really just means showing up on time and having a good attitude. Lots of kids just want to do homework or fuck around on the internet and blow their jobs off.

 Honestly, working during school will help you organize your time and will boost up your resumé. I can now tell future employers that I have supervising experience. I have professional references, etc.

Also, I recommend to everyone who gets a less than ideal financial aid package to contact the office directly and ask to submit a letter of special circumstance. 

20 hours a week isn't too bad freshman-junior years if you pace yourself. I couldn't handle it senior year, but I still manage a good 15.

"I transferred to Reed, and graduated last May. Transfer credits are not incorporated into one's Reed GPA, and they are not listed course by course. They appear on official transcripts below one's course/grade history by year, at the bottom of the transcript.

Basically, Reed translates your outside work into general credits, counts them towards your general credit requirements, and erases your previous GPA from its own records.

[Here's the relevant section of my own transcript](http://imgur.com/eIAHKaK)",basquefire,2013-03-27 18:28:28
"Thanks! That was a great help.

But if the outside work are counted as general credits, is it still possible to count them towards major requirements? How does it work then?",zaryst,2013-03-28 07:34:40
"Is it possible? Sure - but skipping prerequisites and major requirements is rarely systematic. Remember that Reed is a very small school: if you want to skip a class (or audit a class, or get in to a full class), you do so by going to the teacher's office and begging for permission. In order to gain the substitute credit you'll need three signatures, belonging to 1) the Registrar, 2) your academic advisor, and 3) a prof (typically the department chair) of the discipline whose requirement you wish to fill. The specialist's consent and signature is usually the only one that matters; the registrar and your advisor will probably just sign off - especially if your advisor specializes in a different field.

When I tried to fulfill my art credit with extracurricular calligraphy classes I took in Beijing, I basically went to Michael Knutson's studio and asked him if he considered the calligraphic skill I'd acquired to be a substitute for an art credit. He was painting something at the time, and he barely looked up - but he asked me a good number of questions about my calligraphy-learning experience. It was an interview of sorts. Knutson gave grudging consent, but then I couldn't get a paper transcript of extracurricular classes from Beijing - so the transfer fell through.

I had to take an art credit 2nd semester senior year. I took a class on Bach, taught by Ginny Hancock. It was awesome.

Transferring credits can seem convenient, but Reed requirements are typically there for a reason. It's not the end of the world if you can't skip our foundational courses.",basquefire,2013-03-28 07:54:52
"I see. If I acquire the signatures and obtain substitute credits are they listed individually on the Reed transcript? Or will my education look like it has weird gaps unless someone contrasts it with my previous transcripts?

I guess you're right, it won't be the end of the world, but I do want to try to graduate on time and minimize my debts. :/ Well even if it can't be helped I definitely still want to go to Reed though.

P.S. How does auditing work? Does it get listed on your academic record as 'audit'? Would I be allowed to avoid an overload by taking extra classes on audit? I'm thinking that this might be useful if say, I've already got credit for a certain course but I want to experience the Reed way of doing it.",zaryst,2013-03-28 14:41:40
"&gt;If I acquire the signatures and obtain substitute credits are they listed individually on the Reed transcript?

No. You will get transfer credits, and they will be listed at the bottom of your transcript as in the image I posted, and your requirements will be fulfilled - that is, you will not have to take an equivalent of that class.

Auditing works as follows: Ask a teacher to audit a course. Most teachers are game, as long as the class isn't packed already. You'll be expected to attend all classes, do all homework, and otherwise behave as an enrolled student - but you will earn no credit, and it will not be listed on your academic transcript. Non-Reed students can audit courses for a small fee: $100/semester. 

If you're already enrolled and paying tuition, there is little advantage to auditing a course. It does, however, offer really hardcore students the opportunity to do in-depth learning in a hobby subject. If their enrolled workloads get too hairy, they can bow out late in the semester without a ""withdraw"" mark on their transcripts. It also offers non-students the chance to take Reed courses for cheap.

If students demonstrate proficiency in audited classes, professors are quite likely to waive prerequisites for higher-level courses. For instance: I audited Chinese 110 during, and I was granted enrollment in Chinese 210 the following year even though I have no credit for the prerequisite class (CHN110). I audited during my gap year: I had been accepted, but I didn't plan to matriculate until the following year. I paid only $200, and for an entire year I learned Chinese at the same pace as everyone else. When I matriculated the following fall, my professor ran me through a placement test as a refresher, but it mostly a formality - he knew my skill level because he'd taught me for an entire year.

In your case, auditing would be incredibly useful. In fact, I think that learning to do things ""The Reed Way"" is so critical to being a good conference participant that I'd encourage you to formally enroll in foundational courses rather than just auditing them. You might as well earn the credit.

I'm under the impression that graduating ""on time"" is far less common at Reed than it is at other universities. Burning out, fucking up, and freaking out are well within Reed's bounds of normalcy. Pretty much everyone I know who has graduated from Reed experienced some sort of setback or crisis, usually during Junior or Senior year when shit gets tough. If you don't make it through ""on time,"" don't beat yourself up - this community is pretty intense.",basquefire,2013-03-28 15:09:45

"It's not a scam. It's an accredited school with solid academics. That being said, it's super expensive, although there is a fair amount of financial aid up for grabs (especially for minorities). Apply for AEP if you're going to apply, and you can get up to full tuition.

A lot of people transfer after 2 years, and because it's such a small school it might not have quite as much depth as other schools. In general the teachers were great, and I learned a lot. 

Quite frankly, you're friend doesn't know what they are talking about. I was accepted to Reed and was waitlisted at Harvey Mudd during the transfer process. Reed and Mudd are both highly regarded schools, and they would not have considered me, unless they knew that Simon's Rock had adequately prepared me. I'm currently attending Reed and the workload is pretty much the same.

It was ranked as the [#1 Baccalaureate College by the Washington Monthly](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2010/baccalaureate_rank.php).

"I see. I was curious as to whether it was worth it, since I'd be attending in place of my senior year. Reed sends me mail as well, but that would be for after I graduate high school.

Currently I take all my classes at a local community college for free, and I plan to pursue biomedical engineering. My dream school is MIT... does the Early College pose enough of a benefit to justify its cost? Do you think it'll be better?",oldrinb,2012-12-27 18:50:37
"This is sort of a hard question to answer. First off, it's harder to get into schools as a transfer student. There are just fewer spaces available. I do know one person who was accepted at MIT as a transfer, and I was wait-listed at Harvey Mudd, so it is possible. If you're number one goal is to get to MIT, then you'd be better off applying directly.

That being said, my mom is a college counselor and she always tells me about kids who are too focused on big name schools. If your number one goal is to go into biomedical engineering, then I'm sure there are plenty of schools you haven't heard of that would give you just as good of an education. You're probably more likely to get a scholarship at some lesser known schools, and you'll also probably get more individualized focus. I'd encourage you to look into some other schools as well. Also, ratings probably ought to be ignored. The ways they are calculated are pretty questionable, so don't worry too much about whether your school is #5 or #50. What matters is if it's a good school for you.

(As a personal aside, I thought Harvey Mudd would basically be a slightly less prestigious version of Cal Tech. I visited both. I loved Harvey Mudd and hated Cal Tech. If possible, try to visit schools/take a tour and do an interview. It shows interest, and gives you valuable information).

Is it worth it? That depends what you're getting out of your current situation. I applied because I wasn't go to get what I wanted out of my senior year in high school. There was no reason to stay. So for me, it was worth it because it was much better than the alternative.

It depends on your financial situation as well. That being said, I got a full tuition scholarship to Simon's Rock as did some other students. Seriously, if you're going to apply, do the AEP application. It's pretty long, but you can get so much money. I did 2 years at Simon's Rock for about 20K. If you have need, you can get more aid. This is not typical, but the high price tag is mostly rich white kids providing money for poor/minority students (to be perfectly blunt). If you think that it might be a good choice for you, don't just not apply because of the price tag. If you don't get aid, you don't have to go. If you don't apply you won't get a choice.

Simon's Rock has a 3-2 (3 years at Simon's Rock, 2 somewhere else) engineering program with Colombia and Dartmouth. I don't know if that includes biomedical, but I'd look into it. 

You can make Simon's Rock work, but it's not the only choice out there. The transfer process is kind of rough though, and if you don't put in work while you're at Simon's Rock you can get stuck there for 4 years. Some people choose to stay, but I know some who also seemed kind of resentful that they were still there when most of their friends had transferred.

You can make it work if you put in the time to actually get good grades at Simon's Rock. Or, you can fuck yourself over, not finish two years and be left without a high school degree. In the middle are people who wanted to be out in two years, but have to stay for four because they didn't get into any of the schools they wanted to transfer to. They'll probably end up alright, but aren't necessarily the happiest camper in the meantime.

"I recently graduated from Reed (class of 2011), majoring in math and economics, and am currently working at the Federal Reserve for a few years before (most likely) moving on to grad school. The program, in general, greatly prepares you (from what I've heard as I don't have first-hand experience) for the work load of grad school (at least Ph. D. in economics). In fact, Econ 314 (which was my first experience with macroeconomics) is sometimes the first semester/year course in macro at some grad programs. Needless to say, that's probably one of the hardest classes you will take at Reed. It's also the one in which you will learn more about your fellow econ majors, almost inevitable considering that you do the problem sets together for 7-10 hours at a time.  

Depending on the class and the professor, the courses may tend to be more mathematical. For instance, ([reference can be found here](http://academic.reed.edu/economics/courses.html)) 312 ,313, 314, and 315 all require AT LEAST the first semester calculus course (and 312 requires an intro to prob and stats course), and are extremely theoretical and mathematical, partly due to them being the core theory classes. On the other hand, if you have a class with Denise or Noellwah, you will be exposed to math and theory to a far smaller degree than if you were with Jeff or Jon or even Kim. 

The faculty is amazing. I never had a class with Denise or Noellwah, so I can't say much about them (though I've heard Noellwah is incredibly nice and helpful). You will [WERK](http://i.imgur.com/lj6QG.gif) in Jeff's class. He's probably the hardest professor I had, but he realizes that and thus always has his door open. He once came to the computer lab on a Sunday night around 9 PM because our econometrics class was having trouble with a project. Kim does international well, and Jon is super snarky and sarcastic, and NEVER play him in Poker or games of strategy. You will most likely lose. You can't go wrong with pretty much anyone in the department. You will have your favorites (which will probably stem from what your interests are), but you won't have anyone you'll hate.

If you are planning on going to grad school for econ, you should definitely consider doing an interdisciplinary major in Math and Econ. You will need the math in grad school, and it's better to struggle as an undergrad and learn it now, than later.

"Thank you so much for this detailed and awesome response! I'm glad to see that you think so highly of the program. 

One more thing: What math classes did you take and how well will my background in math (I took BC this year and I'm taking LinAl/Multivariable Calc next year) prepare me? ",sonac36,2012-06-06 15:37:48
"In high school I took just AB, but when I was at Reed I took [111, 112, 211, 212, 321, 331, 391, and 392.](http://academic.reed.edu/math/courses.html) They were all useful, though if I could do it again, I'd not take 391 and 392 and instead take 141 and something else.  You'll be plenty prepared, but I still feel that unless you have a very heavy mathematics proof background in your math courses, you might still want to take 112 and the rest. Take a look at the [multivariable calculus textbook](http://people.reed.edu/~jerry/211/vcalc.html) that most of the profs use. (One of the professors wrote it.) If you can follow/understand it easily, then I might ask to possibly skip. But the math department is very very very reluctant to allow you to skip any math classes except 111.",avenirweiss,2012-06-06 16:00:11

In fact, I didn't get a job offer (though I had interviews and such) until late August, but thankfully, it was to the job I had wanted most of all. I can describe the process more later, probably once you yourself are in a position to start applying (most likely if you're interested for working at the Fed, one of the profs will put you in contact with me) when the advice will be more useful. As for being the top of my class, in math, not so much, but I would say that I was top 1 or 2 for economics, not to sounds arrogant or anything.",avenirweiss,2012-06-07 10:33:50

"Well, seeing as nobody else is volunteering, I'll start.

I graduated with a Physics degree a few weeks ago, so I took a few math classes. You'll get the basic set theory from Analysis, which is the first-year second semester class. As far as professors go, it looks like your options are Irena (Swanson), who is tough but awesome and Jamie (Pommersheim), who can make just about any course fun. I'm pretty sure DiffEqs is Tom (Wieting)'s class, so it will be a...safari. I've heard from people who have taken the class that Physics 201 is better if you're just interested in learning how to solve ODEs. With linear algebra, you're options are limited. I took it from Jamie and it was almost interesting, but then again it was linear algebra.",KingOfThePark,2012-05-25 16:53:46

"You can probably get out of Calculus first semester, but you'll still take Analysis second. If you pull some strings you can get into linear algebra sophomore year, which I recommend. DiffEqs is not required, and it's a 300-level class, so you won't need to worry about it until the time comes.",KingOfThePark,2012-05-25 17:14:42
"Yeah, but Differential equations are the coolest! Haha. Thank you for your advice. I'll talk to my Adviser, when I get him/her.",snorky94,2012-05-25 17:19:23
"Reed's math courses are... unique and don't really fit in the Calc 1-3 schedule of most other schools. In addition, depending on your taste you might find them to be too focused on pure mathematics and proofs. The standard math schedule for the first two years is Calculus, Introduction to Analysis, Multivariable Calculus I and Multivariable Calculus II. Considering you have had quite a bit of calc already you will probably get out of Calculus (just talk to a math professor before you register for classes). Depending on your background you will probably have to take Introduction to Analysis (Reed's version of an introduction to proof class - covers set theory, series and sequences, some basic complex analysis, etc.) and will certainly have to retake Multi, even if you have done some multivariable calculus (Reed is one of the few schools where multivariable is a proof-intensive year long course). There are no separate Set Theory and Differential Equations courses (well, there is an ODE class, but that's really more of a topics course - this year it was actually on PDEs).


My advice for you would be to take Intro to Computing your first semester with Jim Fix, if you are even the slightest bit interested in computer science and then take Intro to Analysis your second semester. Also take the Intro Physics sequence your first year. Your sophomore year take Multivariable and if at that point you are interested in a math major try to take Linear and Abstract Algebra. If you think you would like some more applied math, take Physics 200 your sophomore year and some other physics courses your junior year. 


As for professors, I think it's a difficult question. They have different styles and I know that my opinion won't be the same as some of the other math majors. That being said, Jamie and Jerry, as well as David and Irena are some of the more popular professors for the intro sequence. Your choice of professor for Linear probably won't matter much since that course is pretty much the same no matter who teaches it.


PS You can find the course listing [here](http://academic.reed.edu/math/courses.html). I'd be glad to help you if you have any more questions.",,2012-05-25 16:58:56
"Hmm, well it looks like I've already covered all the topics listed in Math 111, 211, and 212 (Calculus and Multi I/II). I've taken them at a community college, so they're not high-school level math classes, and the entire course was already pretty proof-oriented. Then again, I can't really make a comparison. In any case, I feel like it might be a better use of time to take 112 and then 311? I mean, how hardcore would they be about me retaking the Multis, seeing as I have already passed the College-level equivalents, Calc II and III? (do you happen to know what text they use for 111, 211, and 212, by the way?) 

This is, of course going off of nothing but your words and the topic listing on the Reed page.

Thank you for your input, as well! It's greatly appreciated.",snorky94,2012-05-25 17:09:10
"I'm almost certain you will be able to skip 111. I'm certain you will have to retake Multi. To be honest, the course syllabus gives a rather misleading description of the courses. For example, Jerry's 311 isn't a natural continuation of 212, but rather a challenging course best taken after or with Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis (despite the fact that it has a lower number and no such prerequisites). 


Furthermore, even at most colleges the material covered in Multi is likely to diverge from the Multi course at Reed. For example, did your course do the differential forms version of Stokes' theorem? The book used in Multivariable Calculus was written by Jerry and is actually available for download for free from his website [here](http://people.reed.edu/~jerry/211/vcalc.html). Take a look at it and if you are certain you have covered all of this material talk to a math professor before registering for classes, but know that them waiving Multi would be extremely unusual.",,2012-05-25 17:23:17
"Oh, cool! Thanks for that link.

&gt;did your course do the differential forms version of Stokes' theorem

Yes, but I understand what you're trying to get at and I would wager there are things you covered that we did not. I guess retaking them would be really easy with the background I already have. I'll talk to my adviser whenever I get him/her.",snorky94,2012-05-25 17:27:29
"&gt;I guess retaking them would be really easy with the background I already have.

Don't count on it. After 111 (which you'll skip; basically every math or physics major does), they are all pure proof classes. You may not see another number that isn't in e^{i \Pi}+1=0 until Linear Algebra, and even then you'll see very few numbers except in examples on the board. ",VorpalAuroch,2012-05-25 21:37:07

if you want to learn any applied math at reed, you take physics classes. Or bio/chem if it's the statistics but that interests you.",VorpalAuroch,2012-05-26 09:51:24
"I . . . am going to like this place. Awesome, thank you. I'll probably retake Multi 1 and 2 freshman year if they don't want me to skip it. Otherwise I'll just take 311 in conjunction with a beginning physics class. ",snorky94,2012-05-26 11:56:11
"I'd advise waiting a year for 311, so you can take it with Jerry. His 311 was probably the best math class I have taken at Reed (although you will probably want to take Real Analysis before taking Jerry's 311).",,2012-05-26 12:26:26
Alright? is Jerry's 311 restricted to everyone except Freshman?,snorky94,2012-05-26 13:15:07
"Nah, he's just not teaching it this year. The complex analysis class this year should be very accessible, but not as awesome as Jerry's version. Jerry would let anyone take Complex with him, but the class is pretty much incomprehensible if you haven't taken Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra.",,2012-05-26 13:26:43
"Jerry actually does have a habit of scheduling his courses concurrently with freshmen courses with the stated goal of not having freshmen in his advanced classes. For instance, when he teaches a multivariable calculus class, he usually makes at least one session at 9am, right when hum 110 happens. ",OurLastHope,2012-06-30 19:49:28

Just thought I'd mention that VorpalAuroch and [deleted] have pretty much hit the nail on the head. You would have to posses a *very high* level of demonstrated mathematical maturity to skip 211-212. What non-math courses will you take? Hum + Physics 100?,ultimatekiwi,2012-05-27 15:57:08

"I majored in math at Reed.  Here's the math department's course listing:

http://reed.edu/math/courses.html

I had no bad experiences with any professors in the math department, though I had a hard time with Abstract Algebra.  I don't recall taking a dedicated set theory course at Reed.  I took the linear algebra course, and you should too, but you should *also* take computer graphics with Jim Fix.  The computer graphics applications will help you build intuition for linear algebra.  I didn't get a chance to take Ordinary Differential Equations with Wieting and I've regretted that---differential equations is one of those topics that, I think, it's kind of embarrassing to not be any good at if you want to call yourself a mathematician.  Take advantage of every opportunity you get to learn mathematics from Jerry Shurman.

Finally, some general advice:  If you're anything like me you breezed through high school pretty much without trying.  At Reed you will have to try.  When you're doing the reading for any of the math courses have a notebook and pen at the ready.  Take notes in the margins.  Cover up proofs and examples in the text and try to work them out yourself (then read ahead when you get frustrated).  You absolutely cannot learn the math they teach at Reed without actively engaging with the material.  You can't read those little yellow Springer books the same way you would read a novel.

Also, memorize the greek alphabet.  It sounds like a small thing, but it really helps to be able to keep a nice flow going when you're reading mathematics.  You don't want to have to keep mentally stuttering on un-named symbols.",captain_jerkface,2012-11-13 22:00:25

However, I visited Whitman and comparing Whitman and Reed is amazing.

It'll make you cry, that's one of the reasons why we love it."" I highly highly recommend visiting if you have a chance. Everyone there was friendly and helpful and I wasn't led on a stupid ""horse and pony"" show, instead I was kind of thrown into Abstract Algebra and Solid State Physics and was helped by very knowledgable, funny people who were eager to show me around.

"I think thats pretty accurate, having gone to reed for three years now.  My choice was either reed or stanford, but people at stanford were all just so eager to tell you how they went to stanford. Its a great school, but people can get carried away. Reed is a lot more subtle.

That said, its not perfect.  Reed is definitely a magnet for sheltered nerds and pretentious hipsters, but somewhere between the two youll find a bunch of really cool, smart people.  If you dont mind wading through a fair number of cardingans, sideburns and steampunk digimon t shirts, youll be quite pleased with what you find here.

It goes without saying that reed is a fantastic academic school.  The ability to talk to professors in person whenever you want is really amazing, and as a science major im in the unique position of racking up a huge amount of lab time as an undergrad.

"Eh, you'll be fine.  

Or maybe you won't.  I don't actually know you. Lots of people wash out. 

Worst case scenario, you transfer somewhere else.  It's not the end of the world, and you learn something valuable about yourself and the types of environments in which you thrive. 

Reed is about intellectual curiosity, but it's also about rigor.  That means a huge amount of reading in every humanities course, because you can't make and defend rigorous arguments if you have large gaps in your knowledge.  In the harder sciences and mathematics, rigorous ideas tend to be built up from very basic principles, which requires a huge amount of work. ""You can't prove the fundamental theorem of calculus if you can't prove 1+1=2.""  So yeah, there's a lot of work.  

Reed markets itself to the curious because the curious are the ones willing to spend the time putting in the effort.  If you don't care, and are willing to accept that 1+1=2 without proving it yourself, life is a lot easier and less stressful.  You can skip right over this problem and head straight to calculus.  If you can't be sure that 1+1=2, because you aren't even sure if two exists, and you don't know how to prove that two exists even though you've been working on this stupid proof for the past three hours, and you're supposed to be proving the fundamental theorem of calculus in thirteen weeks, you've got a long way to go and it can be very stressful.  You'll feel like an idiot, frequently (seriously, 1+1=2, it's a tricky proof).  Remembering that you are not an idiot is one of the hardest challenges Reed will throw at you.

Those who succeed at Reed are those who are brilliant enough when they arrive that they can teach themselves everything they need to know (read: almost nobody), and those that learn how to ask for help when they really need it.  Reed provides excellent tutoring services in nearly every subject, writing tutors, fantastic access to professors, and a student body that will discuss anything for hours on end.  Most people I know who dropped out (read: plenty, most in freshman year) either didn't make use of those resources or drank/smoked/tripped their face off every night.  Don't do those things.

"I just finished my first semester at Reed. I had similar anxieties before classes started; I was super excited about about attending the school but was worried the work would cause too much stress.

Honestly speaking I didn't find the first semester very stressful at all. Yes there's a lot of work, but unlike high school, you have MUCH more time to work on it. Freshman usually only take 3 classes the first semester, which means most days you'll only have a few hours of classes. I found myself having time to hang out with friends and unwind almost every day, despite the workload.

As everyone will tell you when you get on campus, it gets much harder as you move along. I rarely see seniors just hanging out because they're all very busy thesis-ing. However, I think Reed does a good job of easing students into the academic intensity. For example, readings during the first month or so of Hum are usually only 20-50 pages whereas by the end of the semester they were often over 100.

tl;dr Yeah it's a lot of work but you'll have time to ease into it.

Sorry if this was a longer response than you were looking for! Good luck with your college search.",tds418,2011-12-19 22:21:28
"Reed is difficult in different ways at different times.  There will always be stress; we live in a high-stress culture, and I consider that to be part of our identity.  Part of a Reedie's non-academic responsibility is to constantly consider his or her role in the community.  For more, check out http://www.reed.edu/honor_principle/history_essays.html

These are the (sometimes very enjoyable) stressors I consider to be pretty standard at Reed:

1st year - learning to act in a responsible manner in the conference setting, grappling with living honorably, finding friends with similar values.

2nd year - time management: sacrificing fun for increasing workloads, being forced to pick a major, possibly taking on the independence of living off-campus (very common).

3rd year - meeting Profs' demands for grad-school level research, passing the qualifying exam or process for one's major, considering thesis topics, facing very very difficult finals.

4th year - writing an original thesis, which entails taking real risks and likely venturing into territory which is unfamiliar to even one's Professors.  Wrapping up loose academic ends, specifically graduation requirements.

Ihaveqs: I don't know a single Reedie who's graduated without facing serious stress; most of us almost break at some point, and some of us do break.  To be perfectly honest, I think that learning to face your anxiety is just part of growing up, and you aren't necessarily doing yourself a favor by putting off the process of growing past that weakness.  That being said, Reed generates an abnormal amount of stress; it is not at all uncommon for students to leave Reed because it's just too damn hard.

If you really love to learn, then you'll probably be able to learn anywhere you can find a library.  But Reed won't just teach you facts and technical skills; if you do your part, you'll graduate with the ability to perform independent research in your given field.

I can't tell you if this is the right place for you.  First you should visit: stay in a dorm to find out what kind of people populate our community, and sit in on a class that sounds interesting, to make sure you'd be comfortable in our intense learning environment.  If you like it, apply.  If you're accepted, you get to try it.  But you won't know until you finish your undergraduate experience here (whether by dropping out or graduating) if you made a good choice - and so much of what makes that choice ""good"" or not is up to you.",basquefire,2011-12-19 22:44:10
"Hi. I've done two semesters at Reed and am currently taking a year off due to my acute anxiety disorder. I adore Reed. I love the people, my professors, and the constant level of intense thought that Reed provokes in me. My anxiety disorder, however, is not so thrilled.  

I was diagnosed in high school and had a pretty rough time of it there. Lots of learning coping skills, and trying to figure out ways around anxiety. I fell in love with Reed and worried that because of my anxiety, it might kill me. This is still kind of a valid worry for me, but I don't regret coming to Reed. I've learned far too much, and met far too many incredible individuals in my time there.  

Basically, if you already have anxiety (particularly if it's triggered by academic stressors as mine is), Reed isn't going to be a picnic for you. It's hard, and frustrating, and there will be panic attacks. If that's not something you're prepared to deal with, don't go to Reed. If you're bad at getting help when you need it, don't go to Reed. If you want to put your anxiety behind you and focus on being more ""normal,"" Reed is not for you. It's an environment that causes anxiety for people without preexisting issues, and it's certainly going to bring whatever you're dealing with now up several notches.  

That said, Reed is a very understanding place. My friends and professors are aware of my disorder, and I've never felt negatively judged for it. There are many resources available to you, including tutoring, student services, and the health and counseling center. Maybe I've just been lucky so far, but all my professors have been willing to work with me when I can't make a deadline due to panic attacks.  

I'm not sure how long I'll stay at Reed; that depends on how successfully I can learn to navigate my anxiety. The way things are now, another year would be unsustainable, but I'm hoping to figure out a system that will get me through with at least a shred of my sanity left intact. Even if I end up having to transfer (God forbid), I won't regret going to Reed. My experiences there have been invaluable, and very much worth the angst and strife.",shankingviolet,2012-01-03 11:58:34

"i assume that at this point you've either applied or haven't applied to reed, and either way have drawn your own conclusions, but i thought i'd add my 2 cents in case anyone else is interested. my partner, who i met at reed (we graduated in '07), is currently a phd student at uc berkeley. as part of his program, he has taken a few upper-division undergraduate classes and served as a graduate student instructor for a few more. so, some of these points are straightforward, and others are based on his experience. it may be worth noting that both my partner and i were (are) in the humanities.

-- reed is tiny (1300-ish students when i was there; i think it's similar now); cal is friggin' enormous.

-- reed is all undergrad (the MALS program doesn't really count); cal has many very strong graduate programs.

-- reed's classes are ALL taught by professors; many of cal's undergrad classes are taught by grad students.

-- reed is an educational institution; cal is an educational institution too, yes, but it's also a research institution, and lots of profs are more focused on and interested in their research than in their students -- or, at least, it is also a priority.

-- reed's profs expect students to do a lot of the work, by which i mean students do a lot of primary source reading, in addition to contributing to and even leading class discussions. at cal, it seems to my partner that those expectations aren't there. certainly, undergrads at cal are expected to do a lot less reading than reed students.

-- i suspect that the student-to-faculty ratio is a lot lower at reed than at cal; it would be pretty easy to look up that info. at reed, students know their profs pretty well and vice versa. if you're planning on grad school, that means profs will be writing your recommendations, not GSIs or TAs.

-- if you live in california (and probably even if you don't), cal is a LOT cheaper than reed. that's not a small consideration.",,2012-02-21 13:10:33

"To boil my thesis down to its main point, there are two broad categories (and some contentious subcategories) of film music which have been adapted into video games: diegetic and non-diegetic music.  Diegetic music exists within the narrative world and can be perceived by the characters (e.g. Cantina Band from Star Wars).  Non-diegetic music is external to the narrative and has no in-scene source (e.g. Imperial March).  Non-diegetic music doesn't impact the characters and how the narrative actually unfolds, but it does inform the way we as observers understand the narrative.

It's different in video games because non-diegetic music directly impacts our play and, consequently, the narrative itself.  To further complicate things, those outcomes further affect subsequent actions during play and the sounds that accompany them.  I explored some potential re-divisions of these two categories in order to develop a more powerful vocabulary for ludomusicologists (video game musicologists) to deal with this issue.",BrohannesJahms,2014-07-27 16:52:22
"I'm aware of the differences between diegetic and non-diegetic — what would be an example of a sound in a contentious subcategory?

And with video game music, I can see how a certain theme might affect the player's mood, and thereby their playstyle, or in the case of something like the Left 4 Dead series, there might be certain musical themes which indicate a certain gameplay phenomenon. Is there anything else that you feel directly impacts the player, and thereby the narrative?

Sorry for all the non-Reed questions, but it's a really interesting topic ",AShellForTransfer,2014-07-27 18:55:19
"Some authors break down diegetic music into categories like metadiegetic (occuring at a level between the diegesis and the observer, such as in a memory of flashback sequence).  What's interesting about allegendly non-diegetic music in games is that it has a direct impact on the player, who in turn impacts the narrative in their gameplay choices.  Consider a musical loop associated with combat which plays continuously until all enemies in the area are dead.  The player will likely be on high alert and ready to shoot anything that moves until the combat music ends and signals that it's time to move on to the next part of the game.  Your character might not be able to hear that music, but they behave as though they can because you control them and you *can* hear it.",BrohannesJahms,2014-07-27 20:22:47

"I'm a math major, but I have some experience with the econ and poli sci departments.

1. Can't really answer.

2. From what I've heard ICPS is a little bit of a weird major, because it's not tied to any one department. The thing about being a smaller school is that our departments tend to have relatively narrow focus, so you might find yourself jumping around a lot, academically. Of course, the thing about most majors in that poli sci/econ area is that you really don't have to decide that quickly, unlike some of the math and science majors, there aren't major specific courses that you need to get out of the way early on, so you can try out that area and move away if you aren't interested. The Econ department is really good, I'm fairly sure there are a couple of people in that department who do development economics/political economy, which is what it sounds like you're interested in.

3. It's not a ""brand"" like some other schools, like daloc22 says, but it has a decent alumni network, and Reed students have a good reputation with those who know them. Getting isn't the hardest part about going to Reed

4. I think so, if you're into that kind of thing.

5. It's hard, and it will challenge you. There's a bit of machismo about the difficulty of the academics here, and while it does get talked up a lot, it's still true. You're expected to bust your ass, and do good work, but at the end of it, hopefully, your degree will mean something. That's actually why I came here. 

6. It's technically accessible, there's a bus line that stops in front of Reed that goes straight into downtown, but getting off campus is hard (see point 5). There are cool things to do around town though, if you can manage it. ",gforce121,2014-07-16 08:58:43

"I transferred out of Reed. I knew within the first week of being there that it wasn't the place for me. I just didn't feel about it the way that everyone else there did.

The thing is, I LOVED Reed. The academics are incredible and I grew and developed in ways that I didn't think were possible. I made so many wonderful friends that changed my life, and I look back on my time there with great fondness. BUT, if I hadn't transferred schools I would have always, always wondered ""what if."" I felt like I was missing out on something at Reed and I wanted to get the more traditional college experience. I felt like I was still at Reed, like I was in an isolated little bubble and that when I graduated I would look back and wonder about all of the things I could have experienced somewhere else. I found Reed to be suffocating for me. I'm not a ""normal"" person by any means, but I felt very out of place in my weirdness. I felt like my weirdness was not accepted there because it was not the same kind of weird as I was. Like you said, it's weirdly homogenous. Looking back now I realize that it wasn't a problem of Reed being too anything (too weird, too hipster, too trendy, too whatever), it was a problem of it just not being right for me. I didn't feel out of place at Reed because I was out of place, I felt out of place because I needed a change of environment. It was very scary, and it took a long time to admit that I wanted to leave. But I am so glad that I made the decision to. 

The stress culture exists at other schools. It exists at the school I am at now (although here it is more about being a resume packer whereas at Reed its strictly academic). Stress culture will exist at any prestigious college. What you have to think about, though, is what kind of environment you need to properly develop as a student. Reed did not work for me, it was not the right environment. I wish it could have been, because it's such an incredible and unique place, but it just wasn't. I felt it in my bones. 

I will always feel like I lost something by leaving Reed. It is a part of me, and I will cherish my time there, but I would have lost a lot more by staying there than I did by leaving. Academics aren't the be all end all of life. I feel like I'm in a better place as a student now than I would have been had I stayed, even though I may not have had as great of an education. 

There really isn't a middle ground with Reed. If its not the right place for you, youll feel it. There's a chance that your mind will change by second semester (which is common at Reed), but there is no harm in looking at schools to transfer to and setting up a plan for yourself in case you still feel this way by the end of the year. 

If I can be of any more help, let me know. I spend a lot of time thinking about the experience of transferring and how it has shaped me as a student and as an individual. I would be happy to talk more.",Hollypops,2013-10-26 20:38:51
"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful reply-- you've basically nailed how I feel about Reed. I do have a few questions. Did you transfer out after 1 year at Reed or did you spend longer there? Also, how was your transition to your new school? I'm really afraid of transferring and then having the same problem with disliking my school, but then again, I feel like that most likely would not be an issue if I was to leave for a more traditional college. Also, you mentioned feeling like you were in a bubble at Reed, which is how I feel too, but isn't that feeling existent on any campus, or did you transfer to a school where you managed to feel less isolated?

Like you, I also really admire Reed and love so many aspects of it, I just can already feel my discomfort with the prospect of having to be there for 4 more years. It's really true that there's no middle ground when it comes to Reed. I'm definitely planning on staying the year and we'll see what second semester brings (you said mind changes are common? Did your mind change at all?) but as of right now I'm already looking into plans that will enable me to get out if I'm still feeling the same.

Thanks again!",melimoo,2013-10-27 07:46:34
"I spent 2 years at Reed. The first year, although I had thought about transferring, I was far too scared to take the plunge. Early on in the second year, though, I realized that if I didn't transfer I would regret it, and I started to look into my options.

Transitioning to a new school is very difficult, but I think a lot of it depends on where you end up going. The school I went to didn't have a lot in place for transfers, so It was very, very hard to meet people. People already have their friends from freshman year, and nobody is trying to meet people in the same that that they do in the first year. So it can definitely be lonely. I remedied this by joining a sorority, though. If you do transfer I would consider doing this, because not all sororities fit into the classic sorority stereotype (my certainly does not) and it was a great way to meet a lot of wonderful girls - but again, that depends on the school. I love my school now and I'm really happy, but it took a bit of adjustment time.

On many other campuses the bubble feeling does exist, but I think it feels different because a) Reed is TINY, so it's easy to feel sort of suffocated, b) the weather was hard on me, and again sort of suffocated me, and c) Reed can sometimes feel like being in a club rather than a school, and I think there are a lot of opportunities to try new things and get a little variety at other places. Just to reiterate, this is not me trying to trash Reed at all, because I really don't want to do that. I think these things are only negatives if you feel like Reed isn't your place, but for many people they are positives.

I would say that there are a lot of people at Reed who don't like it first semester and then start to really love it second semester. However, I think those are more people who are overwhelmed or who haven't found the right group of people yet, whereas it sounds like you were a little more like me and feel just a general sense of ""I don't belong here."" That isn't to say that that can't change, but I feel like it's less likely. That could be just my experience though. My mind did change somewhat, in that I became close friends with several people that I loved (and still love, quite deeply, three years later). But loving those people didn't change my situation.",Hollypops,2013-10-27 11:24:30
"This is all really nice to hear, especially that you're happy at your new school even after spending two years at Reed (I'm not even exactly looking forwards to spending an entire year here). And I definitely feel the same about how Reed seems almost like a club sometimes and yes, it makes sense that the tiny size can really enhance the bubble feeling; I think that's been the roughest part for me. Also like you, I can't see myself ever really belonging here... it's just a bummer, because I was truly convinced that Reed was going to be a near perfect fit!

Once again, thanks so much for all your input, it's very reassuring to hear from someone else who just couldn't shake that out of place feeling. ",melimoo,2013-10-27 12:34:22

"I definitely didn't really feel as enthused about and at home at Reed as my fellow freshmen did. And, in retrospect, had I transferred out I'm sure everything would have been fine. But I decided to stay because, to me, the academics and the professors were worth it (I'm a senior now). As time goes on, most of your fellow freshmen will start to quiet down in respect to their excitement about Reed. 

I also have never done drugs (besides weed, which I don't even smoke anymore). Though this makes me feel different sometimes, it doesn't bother me much, as I'm happy with who I am. It seems like you are happy with who you are too. So my advice to you is to stop thinking about it so much (I know, easier said than done!) and just let yourself relax into where you are for the rest of the year. Make your decision in the spring. Ask yourself what the most important thing(s) is for you to have in a college experience. Then ask yourself if Reed will fulfill that. 

Either way, I'm sure everything will work out fine! Remember, if you do stay here, you can always try to find some kinds of clubs/groups off campus where the people might be a little less homogeneously weird. ",moomoopatchoo,2013-10-27 15:58:56

"Yep.

It's something the ""online weight lifting community"" came up with, it would appear. Newbies end up just working their chest and biceps, or ""going to the gym"", while never actually making any serious gains.

"I got through a scholastic year (highschool equivalent) of German on my own using a combination of a few resources. Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur, and livemocha, mostly. The last one is mostly free, but you have to spend money to use more advanced courses (this was quite a while ago so that may have changed), but it is unique in that it connects you to actual native speakers. Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur are VERY good (Rosetta stone when you are on the computer, Pimsleur any other time when you can use audio tapes, don't use the rosetta stone audio tapes if you have access to pimsleur), but they are very expensive. Personally, I didn't spend a single cent on anything, and you can message me about that if you want more info, but I won't go into detail here because the means are... morally questionable.

Far and away the most useful tool, though, was finding friends over in Germany with whom I could talk to regularly over Skype (or whatever you prefer). It gives you a much more interactive experience learning the language that can only be matched by moving to a different country or having a class of other motivated people that are learning the language (a la Reed). It is very hard to stay motivated with just audio tapes.

I would also recommend getting books that are printed in both English and German. I surprise people with my German vocabulary a lot because of utilizing this resource. It can be hard to churn through German translations, though, because a lot of the time the grammar isn't so intuitive.

Viel Gluck ;)

Edit: forgot to mention that I got through a scholastic year *in only five months. I definitely was not making any sacrifices to do it, either.",,2013-01-31 15:48:59
"Thanks. I'll look into Rosetta Stone, and livemocha. I've also tried Duolingo, and it looks okay, but I've heard some complaints about the occasional incorrect wordings on some forums.

Did you go from zero German to that level? On the CEFR, what level would you say you are at? B2? 

I need to get to at least B1 before the end of June.",,2013-02-01 01:55:21
"By ""scholastic year"", do you mean to say that you did Level 1 in 5 months?

Did you do this on top of your other Reed courses? I ask, because if I am studying this nearly exclusively, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that perhaps it could be done in slightly less time.

I've just checked, and apparently all 5 levels of Rosetta Stone take one to B1 level.",,2013-02-01 08:16:04
"I did this while I was in high school, so no Reed courses. I'll actually be finding out if I'm getting into Reed in less than 6 hours =)

It's a little difficult to directly quantify my language learning in terms of school level... In some ways I was certainly beyond a B1 level, but in a lot of ways I would say I did not meet that level. Rosetta stone is the best to streamline your progress if you are only interested in passing some school-like test at some point, as you will only be learning what you need to learn. 1-2 months of hardcore Pimsleur (1-2 hours a day) will get you speaking at an even higher level than ""B1"", but your actual knowledge of grammatical structures will be far behind (you learn things much more intuitively, a lot less actual studying of rules, this is both good and bad, for me it was good, for you probably bad). Also Pimsleur does a relatively terrible job of teaching you to read and write the language. In my opinion, it leaves you basically illiterate if you do it without any supplements, haha.

I learned a lot from books and actual people, so I was not on any sort of fixed curriculum.

The amount of progress I made could definitely be squeezed down to even three months. Like I said, I was not making any sacrifices. I rode buses everywhere in high school so I used that time to get some audiotape time in. A lot of the crap I did in my spare time was spent over skype with German kids (online games, music production), and while that helped a lot, I wasn't exactly doing hardcore tutoring sessions with them, just trying to speak German and getting help. Overall, I would say that more time on @ the computer on Rosetta Stone would be the best thing I could have done for myself. The program gets really mixed reviews everywhere, but I would definitely call myself a fan.

I suppose what you should keep in mind is that I was not learning the language to meet any educational standards, but rather I was simply head-over-heels for a German girl. For what it's worth, I ended up ""getting the girl"", so as far as I am concerned, my language learning endeavors were a success. Would I do well on the German SAT? Probably pretty badly. But, at least I can start a cheesy conversation about trees, right?",,2013-02-01 09:07:56
"ED II results are going out this early? Good luck! If I find myself hating it, wherever it is I end up (could be anywhere between Leipzig and Tennessee at this point), Reed and Chicago are definitely places I'd try to transfer to. After re-doing my whole application from scratch, I realized that many parts of it were very half-assed, and I just failed to see that at the time. 

Anyway. Enough whining. I wish you all the best with Reed. :-)

As for the German. How did you get in touch with German kids? Through some forum? Or livemocha? Something else? 

I also have a German book that I bought a while back at a book store. It's written by some French professors at Supelec (some fancy engineering school there), I believe. It's filled with exercises and stuff, so that should come in handy. 

I don't understand why they suggest one scholastic year for each level of Rosetta Stone. I am currently on Unit 1 of Level 1. I only have 2 activities left in the first Core Lesson (out of 4 + a ""milestone""), and I've been at this for less than 2 hours I believe. If I don't find things much harder, I should be able to do 1 unit per week, without feeling stressed!

Does that sound reasonable?

Did you try reading? If yes, what kind of books? I've been trying to find some of Onkel Dagobert (Scrooge McDuck), from which I learned quite a bit of French with back in the day, but I couldn't find anything at the ""usual places.""

What about TV shows and movies? Any suggestions?

And yes, while I am genuinely interested in the language, and it would be cool to read the Brothers Grimm and Kafka in German, I do need to take an exam in a few months. For one college, I'd need B1. For regular courses at most German universities though, I'd need to be between B2 and C1. I'd need to have B1 to apply, and if accepted, I'd have to attend a ""pre-semester German course."" Or, I could pay for a course at the Goethe Institute.

Was the German girl living in the states/on exchange? And good work man. :D

Sorry for the lengthy post. I talk a lot...",,2013-02-01 11:30:52
"I made friends with German kids by luck, to be honest. I was in the right place at the right time and met a few over the internet whilst playing a game. I became very good friends with one of those, and met all of my subsequent Germans through him =)

I highly recommend finding a copy of The Metamorphosis printed in English and German side-by-side. As far as I know, it's a pretty popular short story to be printed in such a way, but again, I just got lucky finding it (school library). The exact same for the Grimm stories (it's really weird that you mention those, as those are the exact two that I used, (as well as a couple of theater scripts, but I only got so far in those)). As far as tv shows and movies, I would recommend Der Untergang with English subtitles (one of the better films that ever came out of the Holocaust imo) and of course [Schnappi das kleine Krokodil :D](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2B7xwzZJ2M) I watched through a few other films a couple of times but I can't recall which ones at the moment :/

I did not go through Rosetta Stone as linearly as you are, but I was under the impression that each level has much more content than you are implying. Regardless, I went beyond just level 1 (not sure if it was up to 3 or just 2), as should you. Going through the most holistic version of Rosetta Stone at your own pace will be adequate to get to where you want, but not without a bit more effort in other areas. I doubt that will be much trouble for you if you are truly interested in the language, as I certainly was not, haha. I'm faaaar more mathematically inclined to keep learning languages like that. My best tip to you (if you are anything like me) is to stop worrying about planning and to just do your best to learn. You'll find that a month down the road, connecting the dots between all of your resources is very easy, and if you spend too much time searching for the optimal way to learn a language, you will regret not just spending that time getting started :)

"As a current student I have got to say that the writing supplement is probably not that important. Focus more on your Common App essay and your ""why Reed?"" essay.

The advantage for ED, for me, is that there will be less international students applying then. Many international students - around ten times more than they have places for - apply to Reed RD because of their financial aid policy, and some of them will most definitely be better applicants than me (numbers wise; maybe activities wise too, though I'm not sure how that can be measured, or if it should be), and that would greatly lower my chances of getting in.

Now, the physics major is already a full plate, so I don't think there is enough time to graduate with both in four years.

I think the best way to go about this is to major in physics and load up on biology classes on the side. A straight-up physics degree with biology electives will be more than enough to prepare you for any of these specialties.

In general, the physics major is a lot of work, but it does leave enough time to start specializing on the side. The best chance for advancing this is in your thesis.",KingOfThePark,2012-11-12 15:33:31

For example, in the math-physics interdisciplinary major, as you pointed out in the other ""link"",  Reedies take two math courses instead of the j-lab. So, I figured I could petition for an interdisciplinary in bio-physics, and maybe instead of the j-labs, and physics electives, I could load up on bio courses. That way, one would only have to do a single thesis, but would have to pass the quals from both departments. (like with math-physics, and chemistry-physics)

"As someone who graduated with a physics degree (alongside those with the Math-Physics interdisciplinary), I can assure you that both will prepare you more than adequately for a further physics career. The major difference has already been noted: Math-Phys majors are not required to take JLab, an experimental class.

I won't go as far as to say that the Math-Phys major is essentially a theoretical physics major, but the vast majority of Math-Phys theses are certainly more physics-driven. I can assure you that you will not lack for physics as a Math-Phys major.",KingOfThePark,2012-10-12 22:03:09
"Thank you. 

That's reassuring. I didn't realize it at the time, but after having checked, it seems that the physics major is identical to the math-physics one, except that it has 4 additional math courses and doesn't have the 2 J-labs, as you guys said. So, that's two extra courses for the major. A straight-up physics major could have taken physics courses instead. Elementary particles or ""special topics"", for instance. 

Anyway, I guess I'll decide whether to cross the bridge (or swim through) when and if I get to it. Useless worrying. Maybe when the time comes, I'd rather take the two math courses instead of physics ones. Or won't be too bothered that I won't get to take extra courses in non-science fields.

As a physics major, does one still need to take two science courses to satisfy distribution requirements?

What did you (all?) think of physics 101 and 102? I read that it was just Halliday-Resnick. Do the courses follow the text closely or do they get more in depth? Could one potentially just jump straight into 201 or is that preposterous? ",,2012-10-13 00:42:17
"Even as a Math-Phys major, you would have more than enough time to fill requirements and take elective classes. If you want to take Topics or Particles, you will have the time for it (provided you are up for the workload, which you should be, because Particles is the shit). If you are smart and plan your first two years well, you will have the time to take electives. This is well worth the work, especially in the Physics department.

I'm sort of confused about your question regarding Phys 101/102. I was under the assumption that you were already enrolled at Reed, but this would have me believe that you are a prospective student. If this is indeed the case, I strongly recommend just going ahead with 101/102. I showed up at Reed with the mechanics AP under my belt, so 101 was breezy, but 102 was all new (E+M and some Special Relativity). Either way, you need a pretty solid grasp of both newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism in order to get into 201 in year 1. I know a few people who have taken 201 without 101/102, but not many.

Also: Physics satisfies your group C (science distro) requirements.

You shouldn't worry too much about the specifics of your 4-year-plan. Some people come in with a good idea of what they will do and others have none. Plans change. ",KingOfThePark,2012-10-13 02:59:05

He's a nice guy and lectures on some cool biophysics stuff as well as things about ornithology (I enjoyed this part of him, though some didn't), but his problem sets are a waste of time (vocab definitions + easiest possible problems in the book + unnecessary textbook corrections) and you won't learn anything.",InfiniteJest001,2012-10-13 11:42:47

"I have no clue, at the beginning of the semester he said something along the lines of teaching physics ""the liberal arts way"" which after going through the class I took as ""teaching physics in an extremely easy manner so people taking the course for the science requirement can have a light time"".

But I also don't understand it since very few people actually take it to fill in their science requirement; it seems most people who lack interest in science/math (not everyone) tend to take chem/bio or at PSU (Which I don't understand, intro science classes aren't hard...). It seems like people like Johnny more in the upper-level classes, and he's a great thesis adviser as well.

His course is actually the primary reason I chose not to major in physics and just stick with math (I did not ever want to have a course with him again). I know several people who also did this. So be wary, I guess, Johnny gave me a negatively-filtered view of the physics department (though I loved Lucas first semester and every other physics professor I've met has been great).",InfiniteJest001,2012-10-13 11:55:54

See, that's one of things I failed to take into account. That is, whether a teacher would put me off a certain subject. This actually happened to me in high school, so I can understand.

I would hate to take a physics class like that. It sounds ""fluffy"", at best. If Reed hired the guy, then I'm willing to bet he's a good teacher. If he, by any chance, comes across this ""submission"", it'd be interesting to see what he thinks!

Make the most of freshman year, really. Also don't let your adviser sign you up for only three classes freshman year. Unless you really don't give a damn. Hum counts for 1.5 credits/sem , yet it's the only class you can somewhat BS at Reed. Take 4.5 credits (four classes). It will help you out in the long run. 

Learn to use the public transportation and get around. Portland is a really cool city. 

Also, a lot of Reedies suck. They are just too into themselves. People are really awkward. You have no idea how many times I met people, only for them on the 20th time or so to realize ""how cool I am"". 

I have however found a handful of awesome people that I wouldn't change anything for. Too bad I met them so late. 

Also, ALWAYS sign up for gray fund trips. They are free trips (with food) that the school pays for. You get in by lottery. If you don't get it, don't worry. You can wait by the vans for a spot. I got to go to Wicked and Anjelah Johnson, and I got the other AJ trip by van-waiting. Free food. Really, do these. The only thing they ask is for these trips to be drug and alcohol free. Also, ski-cabin at Mt. Hood. Reed has one. ",babyliongrassjelly,2012-06-12 21:20:57

"It's mostly up to you. Freshman year doesn't have to be difficult - Hum 110 is primarily training in responsible conference participation, fundamental research, and the formation of basic arguments; 100-level classes in the sciences are designed to weed out those who aren't really enthusiastic about a particular field.

In other words, your freshman year provides you a (relatively) slow-paced environment in which you'll learn how to learn, the Reed way. Forget about your high school experience. Go in with an open mind and a willingness to sit and learn patiently. 

It's healthy to be scared. Now go wade in anyway.",basquefire,2012-06-11 20:21:12
"I'm an incoming freshman as well but from what I have read they do a pretty good job of giving you a manageable amount of work for freshman year. After that I hear it becomes a lot more difficult but is still possible if you use your time as well as possible. Though, I have also heard that sometimes profs. will assign more reading than is possible and it is just up to you to prioritize what to do. Either you will be fine and get everything done, or you won't and either you transfer or you just perform a little poorly. I hope that this is mostly accurate, otherwise I am just as frightened as you. See you next fall! 

Also, it will be fun! Academic masochism is what it's all about, and you will have tons of other freshmen in the same boat as you so we can share in your pain.",holyathiest,2012-06-11 18:33:19

Freshman year is really manageable, as long as you work a bit every day (Don't take a break for a week at a time from homework) Nothing is too hard, and Hum, although it depends on your conference, really allows for you to drop for a week at a time if you need to catch up on other classes. However, if you're a really slow reader, that may affect how much time you have to take for each class by a lot. (I'm a pretty fast reader, so I was able to get through Hum readings pretty quickly) ",Angstmuffin,2012-06-12 21:45:14
"Haaaa, I feel like this question was directed at me. I was the same as you in high school. Not particularly ""genius"" by any means, but I wasn't an idiot and I could write a pretty damn good paper and generally got shit done on time (even with the procrastination). I was a freshman this year and because of depression/anxiety issues that came with feeling like I wasn't as smart as my peers, I had to leave after the fall semester (yep, I'm a fuckin' pansy ass pansy, but it's all good, I guess; then again, I was also interested in hard sciences which can be tricky if you're not prepared). Anyways, you really do need to sit your ass down and do your work or else you'll get fucking owned. That's your answer. If you aren't really dedicated to what you're doing, you'll be miserable and you'll get yourself into some trouble. I'll tell you right now: **don't fucking do that!** Stay on top of things and you'll get through it.
 
I can also agree with babyliongrassjelly:
 &gt; Health and counseling sucks ass. They really do.
 
I went to them several times and they were pretty much fuckin' useless to be blunt. You need to find a group of people you really like and stick with them if you want a good support system. Your fellow classmates/dormies/roommate (if you have one; of course, I didn't, which probably hurt me more than helped) will be going through most of the same shit you do; **ask for help when you need it.**

However, I really love the school itself. Despite making me an emotional mess (I did have some previous baggage too though), I think if you can make it work for you, it's a really rewarding place to be. Sure, you have some people that are pretty arrogant and full of themselves as I'm sure you would anywhere you go, but you can also meet some pretty interesting and fun people too!

At least two dance parties a week.  

Granted, a lot of time spent is in various clubs, rather than large gatherings. We have everything from cheese club to club-that-builds-giant-things, and it's super easy to get together a few people and get funding for whatever you want to do. 

However, Reedies aren't particularly social, and you might be hard-pressed to find people to drag along with you. Reedies love doing things they're passionate about, and if they're not passionate about something, there's reading that they should be doing instead. Most events take place on the weekends, but clubs &amp; such are interspersed. As for deciding what to do on a weeknight? 9 times out of 10, it's going to be homework or straight chillin' because doing stuff is exhausting. Reed also doesn't seem to be unique in the events it offers, but because we only have 1200 kids there's just not as much quantity. There's still stuff for sure, but not oodles and oodles of things.

The sheer volume of nerdy people can be frustrating at first if it's not your style, but you'll find the people you want to spend time with.  Some of them may even be attractive.  

The best part is, as someone interested in education and who takes your field seriously, you'll be surrounded by likeminded people who are just as committed as you.

"I just started this fall as a transfer student (from a community college here in Portland) and, while I am a unique case because I'm 27, I still have gotten a feel for the student body over the six weeks. I stand to be corrected by those who might have been at Reed longer. My observations: 

There are some of the ""weirdos from high school here"" .. more than weirdos though, seems to be the kids that might have been the smartest kid in their class for most their life and have the capacity of thought to be painfully self-aware. I think the combination of those traits, at the 17-20 year old age group, breeds a kind of individualism that purposely eschews ""fitting in"". So there are those types.. and if you're one of them, you might find your people here. 

Then there's everyone else. For the most part the students at Reed are easy to approach and interesting to talk to, although they mostly talk about school. That's the characteristic we all share, I think, we're interested and engaged in our studies. The stress of the volume of work and intensity of some classes can make people push aside social aspirations so maybe they don't seem as social and outgoing at times. 

Of course there are the ""cool"" kids.. I don't know exactly what I mean by that because I'm 27 and it would take some serious steez to convince me that a 18-21 year old is anywhere near ""cool"", but there's the hipster-y, arts-y types that aren't as approachable and friendly as the greater majority of students. I don't worry about them. 

I was really worried about starting conversations and making friends the first week of school but in every circumstance that I took a chance, I was happy I did. The students here are interesting and passionate, if a bit hifalutin at times, we're all learning so it's okay.  

The worst thing about students at Reed, in my opinion and by no means applies to everyone, is the general callousness of taking care of public spaces, littering and talking while a professor talks. Students were less well-mannered than I expected but again..that might be an age thing. 

Don't worry about not having parties. There are plenty of parties. I think Reed actually has a reputation for partying. Someone more in the social scene at Reed would speak to that better than me though... 

Good luck with your application process! ",GlitchInStroma,2014-10-07 13:45:54
"&gt;I am forced into a state of despondency and envy, because so many others have been fortunate and lucky regarding financial aid.  
  
Late to the party, but gotta say, **Dude, that's just ridiculous.**  You *really* need to check your privilege.  Readers should know that you've conveniently omitted how poorly you did during your short time at Reed and that you were depressed while there (attributes provided in your comment history, which you later nuked).  The vast majority of parents would be satisfied if their student were happy and achieving well at college; however, yours weren't because you weren't.  Parents are wise to reconsider the expense in light of those ""special"" circumstances.  
  

  
Evidently, you did not love Reed enough to do what most Reedies must do to attend their dream school.  No, it's definitely not for everyone, and, apparently, it wasn't for you.  Sorry it didn't work out for you, but please, please, bag the inappropriate overprivileged envy bullshit and quit dissing the amazingly generous financial aid.  If you were actually needy [and making the requisite academic progress], you'd get it.  
  
Rather than to deny your agency in this scenario and then whine about how wealthy your parents are, you could instead declare yourself independent of them, i.e., support yourself, and then attempt to qualify for aid on the basis of your own finances -- though your academic record likely blows that option at this point anyway, at least as far as attending Reed is concerned.  
  
  
By obfuscating the truth, what you've done here is not honorable.  It's  frankly another indication that you were not cut out for Reed.  ",W_T_Foster,2014-03-25 13:29:59

I have met many, many people outside of Reed who I think would fit in really well there. Try to keep an open mind as you meet new people on this journey. Reed is mostly about having a love of learning and an open mind, and if you hone those qualities in yourself then you'll unconsciously send off those signals that let other open-minded, learning-loving people gravitate toward you.

The flipside of that coin is that your parents also have enough money to support your education. I'm not sure that either is responsible, but you're the one who loses out as the result.

It may be possible to declare yourself financially independent; this happen automatically at the age of 24, and can potentially be done earlier. If you are considered independent, Reed will not examine your parents' finances in determining aid - only yours.",basquefire,2014-02-05 09:39:47

"1. Reed's curriculum is very old school. All of the programs are purely academic; there are no engineering or other vocational programs. The emphasis is on gaining a deep understanding of the material and teaching you how to think analytically, rather than simply retaining information so that you can pass a test. There is indeed a healthy amount of work.

2. About 50% of Reed's students receive financial aid. That says a lot more about the students than about the college though. I don't have a number off the top of my head on the average financial aid award but it is in the $30,000 range. The college guarantees that it will meet 100% of financial need and in general, it will provide enough financial aid that you will be able to attend.

3. Biology and Psychology and the two largest I believe. I don't know if I could point out departments that are necessarily ""the strongest."" Reed's programs are very uniformly strong across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The bigger issue is the lack of programs that you may be interested in.

4. The senior thesis is a year-long research project that every Reed student must write the graduate. Seniors typically put hundreds of hours into researching and writing their theses (or performing their experiments, as is the case for science majors). Seniors are given their own desks in the library to keep their books and work on their thesis. At the end of the year, seniors must defend their thesis in front of a panel of professors.

I'm now realizing how much I sound like the Reed admissions department. It's a great school. The culture is rather unusual so I would recommend visiting before you enroll and you will probably get pretty burned out by the workload if you come here. Even so, if you are the right type of person for Reed then it is very much worth it.",Jlpanda,2013-12-07 22:55:35
"1. Well, freshmen year is pretty different from the rest of your time at Reed. You have Hum 110 all year long, where you read things like Homer, Herodotus, and other classics. That class has both a lecture and conference component, but most other classes are conference style. Meaning you sit around a table and just discuss various things related to the class. 

It's fairly conservative. This means you probably won't get the opportunity to take classes like Gender in Comic Books. I think Reed's rigor is a little overhyped by students, but it does have a ""healthy amount of work.""

2. Not sure. They were pretty generous when I went there, but I've heard they've become less so. If you actually need it, they'll likely give it to you. I don't know what you mean by easy. The financial aid people are nice, remember to be nice back to them. They don't not want to give you aid. 

3. I think Bio has the most? I can't say which programs are the strongest. I know Bio is well regarded. 

4. Pretty much like the thesis process at any other school. It differs from department to department, but you spend a year writing a thesis. In most departments you come up with a few proposals and discuss them with a prof you're interested in working with. The professors in each department then go over their students proposals and vote on whether to approve them. Then you spend a year researching and writing. I found the thesis fun and rewarding experience. A lot of people bitch about it, but it is what you make of it. But I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you end up going there you won't be thinking about it until the end of your junior year. ",grandmasterfunk,2013-12-07 22:48:06
"Hi. Glad to hear you're looking into Reed.

1. The one big thing Reed has that's different from a lot of other places is Hum 110, which all freshmen take. The syllabus is online. It's pretty unique and worth a thorough look. For everything else, looking into your department would be the best way to learn about the curriculum. We don't have grades (well we do, but you don't see them). The professors are really approachable, tests aren't a major point of focus, and the atmosphere is collaborative instead of competitive. Overall, it's great. Yeah, there's a lot of work, but if you're into the whole liberal arts thing, it's worth it.

2. Half of students get financial aid. Need-based only. Look at the website for details.

3. We don't really have any weak programs, and the students are pretty well distributed across majors. I'm sure stats are available somewhere, but there's no one major that it seems like is disproportionately large.

4. Thesising depends a lot on the department you're in. It ranges from a 4-page math proof to a 700-page science fiction novel to a 110-page essay on ethnomusicology and its relationship to politics in Angola. It's a full year's project (also look into the qual - our junior qualifying exam) which you turn in at the end of your senior year during Thesis Parade, which kicks off Renn Fayre. I mention this because Renn Fayre is a pretty big deal, and you should know about it.

Hope that helps. I'll try and respond to any other questions you have, but the Reed website is pretty thorough and easy enough to find info on for things like financial aid. Good luck in the application process!",keeptrackoftime,2013-12-07 23:37:21
"edit: should mention, I'm a Biochemistry &amp; Molecular biology junior:

1) Reed's curriculum is very classic and has a heavy focus on how you think, not what you know. 

2) Financial aid is need based. Generally you can get what you need, but not quite as much as you want.

3) If I recall, Reed biology has been ranked as the 2nd or 3rd best biology program in the nation at two separate times (Princeton review) Reed chemistry is very well respected as well (Bio-chem major here)

4) Senior thesis are projects generally directed as displaying a level of comfort and mastery with your major such that you can do original research or in some other way contribute to the field yourself. Many students in the sciences work on extensions or verification of papers published in their areas of interest, or else collaborate with a professor on the professor's own research projects to find a topic to study.

"The longer you wait, the weirder the transition will be. 


There are also enough requirements for graduation at Reed, that it's hard to do with fewer than 3 years at Reed. While you can often get credits for your previous classes, they sometimes don't fulfill requirements as far as classes go. So, you may just lose out on elective classes, and still have to do all of the classes within your major.


Finally, the junior qualifying exam is no joke. And while it's different from major to major, it typically is testing on the types of knowledge and critical thinking you would learn in the classes taught by the professors at Reed. For instance, the year I was a senior, only about half of the anthropology juniors passed on their first try of the junior qual. The reason? Mostly that the ones who didn't pass had picked one favorite prof and taken almost all of their classes within the major with her, and hadn't been exposed to the other profs' theoretical perspectives and methods of analysis.

Tuition waiver is great for community college *if* those years get you somewhere. So if you're raising your GPA or if those credits transfer to another school well, then that's excellent.

From your reply, that seems pretty accurate.",pillowpuff,2013-10-22 18:51:32
"Hah! Reedies do indeed like to brag about how heavy their workloads are - during freshman and sophomore years. Junior and senior years, they're typically too stressed out to put energy into bitching about it. You can just see it in their faces.

The weird thing is that the entire Reed community puts the suffering, thesis-writing seniors up on a pedestal. This is manifested in a couple of different ways: the school paper has weekly ""postcard from thesis hell"" and ""sexy desperate senior"" blurbs, the Orgy-Porgyish event which inaugurates the yearly blowout party begins with a burning of thesis notes and spraying the graduating seniors with champagne, etc.

Both the undergraduates and the staff see and celebrate this completion of what can actually be a fairly hellish task (it doesn't have to be; some suffer more than others). Since the freshmen necessarily see the seniors as role models, they too aspire to pass the gauntlet. Then they become sophomores and their workload rises; their groans inspire the freshmen, who use their oodles of free time to bitch about how much free time they don't have. That's ok. The workload just gets heavier every year, and we all eventually come to realize our freshmen selves weren't actually that hardcore. We were just aspiring martyrs.",basquefire,2013-10-22 19:08:46

Portland is a pretty excellent little city, although to be fair I never really got to know it as well as I should have. Rent is cheap, as are food and beer (the former is probably better in Portland than in any other US city, and the latter is disproportionately good for a city of Portland's size).

The weather is pretty bad. It's generally very pleasant for the 4 months including the end of spring, all of summer, and the beginning of fall. The rest of the time, though, the default weather is drizzle. It pours sometimes, and it snows maybe 2-3 times/year, but very rarely sticks for more than 24 hours. The drizzle sucks, though, because the grey monotony aggravates the academic slog.

Don't go to Reed for the city or the weather. If you go to Reed, go despite the weather, and perhaps stay because Reed incidentally happens to be in a very cool city.",basquefire,2013-10-22 21:07:47

"I feel as if fitting it all into a short comment would be an impossible feat. To summarize, the emphasis on academics and open discussion is something that seems critical to an institution I attend. The atmosphere and community seem like something that would fit me, with the elimination of fraternities and sororities and an overall focus on unity throughout the entire populace. 
The physical environment of the area. Oregon's climate to be more precise. 
And that motto is a glorious thing, to be honest.
But all of this is pure speculation, and I have yet to discuss the accuracy of these descriptions with someone who currently attends or attended Reed.
If you would like for me to elaborate, or care to discuss possible flaws in  my views of Reed, I would love to go further in depth. ",nate20140074,2013-05-19 20:45:10

If you can't fit it into a short comment, I'm willing to read a long comment.

I graduated last May, and I now work full-time as a standardized-test prep tutor. I strongly advise you to prepare for and take the SAT and/or the ACT. It might not be a bad idea to take them cold, just to see where you stand - the last SAT of the season is June 1, and the last ACT of the season is June 8. There are no summer testing dates.",basquefire,2013-05-19 20:59:43
"For open discussion, I've always believed that open discussion is a huge role in education. In an academic institution, I've always felt that simply learning the material was never enough, but being able to discuss the material, or even issues relevant or irrelevant to your studies was a true sign of an institution dedicated to learning.

For unity throughout the entire populace, while I understand the idea behind fraternities and sororities, I feel like they caused a separation throughout the community of an institution. With Reed, there seems, from my perspective at least, to be an emphasis on pushing towards a community that includes the entire college as one, unified group.

I feel as if my view might be flawed because it is pure speculation based off of what I read, or what I hear. I have no actual experiences related to Reed that I can base it off of. Simply put, I haven't attended Reed or talked to someone who has.

As for my standardized testing scores, I have been preparing for the ACT in June, but I am unable to take the SAT because my family does not own a vehicle fit to transport me to the nearest testing site for it, which is approximately an hour or two away. ",nate20140074,2013-05-19 21:10:12

"I looked into that program when I was a freshman (which was almost a decade ago). I talked to a few profs who discouraged me for reasons I honestly can't remember now. I didn't end up being an art major, though I took a bunch of art classes and was partially in the arts division (as an interdisciplinary literature-theatre major). What would you be interested in studying at PNCA? 

I think your major at Reed has to be studio art or art history to do the dual degree program, so what would you be considering double majoring in? Double majoring is possible at Reed, and I knew a couple folks who pulled it off. I don't think the workload is usually the toughest part (depending on how similar your majors are); it's the whole writing-two-theses thing that usually turns people off. Interdisciplinary majors are way more common and (imho!) totally rock. If you convince your profs that they're related and you can write a thesis that proves it, you can create an ad-hoc interdisciplinary major in whatever two departments you please, or there's a bunch of established interdisciplinary programs.",,2012-12-14 00:05:29

Just thought it *could* have been you, seeing that few people get such scores. Let alone, international students, who usually do bad on critical reading (based on my observations) AND the average grades/great SAT score combination.

Side (but somewhat related) note: I hear law schools are pretty nasty with grading. Looks like it has a lot to do with making it hard for people to maintain their scholarships. Good luck, have fun!

Anyway, with my having such bad grades, would you say it's still worth it if I retake the reasoning test instead of trying to do great on the subject tests? Or maybe I could take the subject tests and apply early anyway. Then, if I don't get in (hopefully, I get deferred instead of rejected), I could retake the reasoning test in January.",,2012-10-13 11:41:31
"Yes. Yes. Absolutely yes. Don't sell yourself short. I can tell you now, looking back at the SATs, SAT subject tests, and the LSATs: testing matters. If you're bad at it, that's unfortunate, but it's no excuse to quit. You will regret every ten points you miss out on (or every point on the LSAT). It's not the end of the world if you do poorly, but doing well on the SATs will give you an extra set of opportunities. Work hard, put every ounce of energy you have and be proud of your score at the end of the day.

With that being said, Reed looks for different things in students. I've seen my admissions file (perks of knowing admissions officers after graduation), and I know my work ethic (started working full time at 14) was important in getting in. So work hard, spend the time trying to improve on the subject tests and address your grades head on in one of the essays. I don't think it's worth traveling to Reed when you can dedicate that time/money to improve your application (or life!) rather than showing interest that can be demonstrated by applying Early Decision.

"Reed is fairly well known for being quite generous when it comes to grants/scholarships/etc. A lot of this is going to depend on your parents' EC (expected contribution), which is largely based on their income. The less they make, the more grants you get (and less loans). The more they make, the grants go down and the loans go up. 

If we just go middle of the road with the estimate of grants you will receive, that means you'll be on the hook for ~$80k in costs for 4 years at Reed. A lot of people will supplement this with scholarships (Id recommend going to a local bookstore and looking for a book that contains listings for scholarships), and working part time jobs. 

TL; DR: With the amount of money you have saved up, I don't think you're going to be prohibited from attending Reed from a financial standpoint. You'll probably walk away with debt (as do 90%+ of college grads) and you'll be paying it off for quite some time.

"For transfer info you should check out the Common Data Set of both schools.  Georgia Tech accepts more than 50% of transfer applicants, 85% of which enroll, and has substantially lower admissions standards than Reed.  Reed accepts 27% of transfer applicants, of which 43% enroll.  Your stats are good enough for Georgia Tech, but very likely not good enough for Reed without also having stellar recommendations and a rock solid ""Why Reed?"" essay, and even then it's a crapshoot with your scores.

GPA is fairly low, but not reported (we don't get our grades unless we ask) so I don't know.

A fair number of transfers. No idea what the norm is.

For scores and thing: No idea. Like I said, it doesn't come up that much.

Reactor program is one year of training, about a full class's worth of work for no credit and no pay. If you're one of the 15 who get an operator's license at the end, you can work for the remaining years at the best-paying campus job, which consists of pressing 6 or 7 buttons and writing in a logbook.

We're awesome. We have one of the best amateur fire-dancing troupes around. Reed has the best possible drug culture; things are fairly available and socially acceptable, but with zero pressure to experiment if you don't want to.

It's really terrific to hear about my apparent lack of critical thinking skills (engineers clearly can't think critically), but I would pass up Reed any day to attend GT.

By the way, which rankings are you looking at? Because the ones you just quoted from wikipedia are from 1961...perhaps you should try this critical thinking gig out. Do you seriously want to play the rankings game? If you look at the rankings for GT, you might find something like this:

&gt;Tech has the No. 4 undergraduate engineering program, and the No. 4 graduate engineering program.[53] All of Tech's undergraduate engineering programs are among the Top 10 in their field including its Schools of Industrial Engineering (1st), Mechanical (2nd), Aerospace (2nd), Biomedical (3rd), Civil (3rd), Electrical (5th), Environmental (5th), Computer (6th), Materials (9th) and Chemical (9th),[53][55] and Industrial Engineering (1st), Biomedical (2nd), and Aerospace (2nd) at the graduate level.[56]

"This is pretty much it, there are just ~~two~~three things I'd like to add:

* It is my impression that they prefer to give operator licenses to freshmen or sophomores because those students will be able to put in more to the program due to a longer time at the reactor. Also, there is a minimum number of hours/week you need to work to maintain your license.

* My impression of Georgia Tech is that it is a very big school, at Reed you *will* get to know your professor. Since most classes are conference style, it's almost impossible to not know some of them personally. It's not as intimidating as it sounds. 

* Also, though grades are not emphasized, that doesn't mean the coursework is easy, or that everyone gets A's. Grade inflation does not exist at Reed, in fact when the registrar sends transcripts it encloses a letter explaining how grades work here.

"&gt; Tell me about campus,

Campus is pretty swell. There's a lot of mixing between freshman and other classes in the dorms, and if you want to live in theme housing then you can find a lot of friends right off the bat.

&gt; tell me about Portland,

Portland is kind of dreary and miserable for 6-8 months out of the year, but when it starts getting nice (right around this time of year) it's gorgeous.

&gt; and tell me what you would do in my shoes.

Well there's the rub. I can't really tell what is best for you because I'm not you. The best I can do is ask you some questions and make vague blanket statements.

First off, will debt be an issue for you later in life? As in, are you comfortable spending the next decade or more paying off a few years of education?

Next, what is it about Reed that excites you so much? If you haven't visited campus then you'll basically have to rely on brochures and hearsay. Is size the only important difference between Reed and UT Austin, or are there other factors as well?

I don't like giving advice because every situation is different, but something you could try is to accept the full ride, get some credits out of the way, and transfer to Reed after a year. That way you'd be able to visit Reed and verify that it's really worth all that money.",schwoopdaloop,2012-04-24 09:23:28
"Hello McDickolson, 
I am a prospecting transfer to Reed from a smallish town in Northern California. I have to wait until May 1st to find out if I got in (or later) but I did recently visit the school and hope my insight and similar position can lend some aid.

The campus is, over all, pretty small. It has a lot of open green space, beautiful trees, and great architecture, but there aren't a ton of buildings. Even better, you don't get any grey looming buildings sucking your soul at as you walk to and from class. 
Even though the campus is in the middle of portland it is isolated. With a gold course on one side, lake on another, and the rest being Reed housing and campus you feel like you're separated from the rest of busy portland. I absolutely loved the campus, and the students you see around you are all unique, quirky, and absolutely amazing. Like schwoopdaloop said, a lot of mixing with all class levels and no judgement there.
On my interview with a councilor there she said this great quote ""Reed students take school and academia seriously, but not themselves.""

Portland was told to me in a very simple way: It is 90% rain and 10% beautiful weather. Essentially, the dream of the 90s is still alive in portland, but the city is busy and wonderful. Not to mention, absolutely gorgeous.  

If I was in your shoes I'd simply say go to Reed. If you can make Reed work, do it. I should get FA help and be okay, but my girlfriend is facing the same predicament. As long as you know you can pay for it, even if you have to fight tooth and nail, I say go. If you aren't sure and might have to drop out because of money issues, then don't go. It would hurt you financially, your education, and means you lose a year of school because you don't have the money for it. 

Hope this helps!",MooseBear,2012-04-27 13:39:29

"Pre-med isn't a major at Reed, so you'll have to choose some other major and take classes to prepare yourself for medical school a la carte. Since you have to fulfill a major's requirements on top of taking supplementary classes (on top of distribution requirements), you'll be doing extra work (and a regular Reed courseload takes its toll on most people). If you're sure you want to go to medical school and not sure you can handle an extra-large courseload, Reed probably isn't the right place for you. ",GiskardReventlov,2014-11-11 19:34:37
"No, and many people will [seriously/purposefully] major in things like dance or anthropology and take enough bio and chem courses to get into med school (as a planned pre-med career path). They tend to have success getting into med schools due to the fact that they are non-traditional, but super-qualified. There's nothing more boring to a med school admissions board than a traditional ""pre-med"" major from a school that has that path.  (Many other reedies will do a bio-chem major and also be successful through med-school.)

However, there are other excellent options if you are really really med school focused. For instance the Claremont Colleges (or at least Scripps) has a fast track program in which you apply to med schools in your junior year and have a hybrid grad-school/senior year.

Are low grades quite common in the lab science courses at Reed?,Timberduck,2014-11-11 22:18:10
"C's are fairly common, B's moreso. I'd say the average of Reed lab science majors who really button down and make sure to get good grades is around 3,2 +/- 0,4. [Mine is a good chunk lower because I started as a physics major before moving into biomed]


Reed does not have traditional grade inflation. However, Reed is ranked in the top 10 undergraduate institutions for both biology AND chemistry. Most halfway decent organizations respect that and will make adjustments accordingly. Luckily Reed offers more lab experience, connections, resources and higher quality teaching than just about anywhere else (I've looked). 


In my opinion it's not really a question of what you look like on paper, Reed will actually make you into a competent researcher or practitioner capable of doing things and understanding the broader scope. 


I wouldn't come to Reed to get a ticket to med school, and if that's all you're looking for Reed isn't the right place for you. Reed is a place to grow as a person and an academic, while learning a huge swath of knowledge both broadly and deeply, and really if you only look at the end goal of the institution you're going to miss out on that.

We make a point to be accepting of any and all kinds of anti-normative behavior. That's probably the reason it doesn't seem like there's a huge LGBT community; they're just another part of the community at large, and nobody labels anybody primarily by gender identity. Basically, if you want to be accepted no matter your personal preferences, this is probably one of the best places, if not the best, to come in the entire country.",notgoodwithnames,2012-04-28 20:36:55
"Thank you for the reply! Just a few questions:

* What do you feel that your school is best at, academically and socially?
* How many discussions do you get in over constructive disagreement? Do people have very similar opinions? (I've worded this very poorly)
* How is Portland?

"Academically, I'd say we're best at teaching you how to think: how to research a topic and formulate and construct an argument about it. I would say that when it comes to political matter, disagreement is very rare: you're either very left wing or extremely left Wong. But if you want to talk about philosophy or literature or art, you are bound to find someone who will approach the question in a different way from you. This is one of the things that makes conference classes do great, people will disagree with you on anything and everything and force you to back up your opinions. One great thing about the community is that it really feels like people will listen to you. They're firm in their opinions, but not immune to a rational counterargument. I don't get into Portland very often, but I'm glad when I do. It's a great walking town, filled with boutiques and food carts, and there's a very clear sort of ""street life"" that you don't get in a lot of cities. The neighborhoods within walking distance of Reed are also great for the occasional getaway, but work and campus life will be enough to keep you occupied if you choose to stay on campus.",notgoodwithnames,2012-04-28 21:03:18
"Sounds awesome =) Thank you so much! I'll be applying this fall, without a doubt.",dacheatbot,2012-04-28 21:13:43
Great to hear it! Have you visited?,notgoodwithnames,2012-04-28 23:47:14
"Not yet, but I hope to soon. Any recommendations on what to do on a campus visit? Is staying overnight an option?",dacheatbot,2012-04-28 23:51:27
"Staying overnight is definitely an option. You can always sit in on some classes and lectures, and if you just hang around some public spaces and say you're looking, people will be more than happy to talk to you. Of course, seize the chance for an on-campus interview. Assuming you get accepted, you might want to come back for [RAD](http://www.reed.edu/apply/accepted/rad.html). There's a ton of stuff specifically tailored to visitors, and you'll be surrounded by potential future classmates.",notgoodwithnames,2012-04-29 01:42:12
I was a physics major here -- anything specific you'd like to hear about?,etaoin,2012-04-28 21:56:08
"Oh yes!

* How is the quality of the staff on department? Consistently good? or more of a mixed bag?
* Are professors easily accessible?
* If you're having difficulty with your work, how easy is it to get help?
* Did you have many research opportunities?

Thank you so much for your help!
",dacheatbot,2012-04-28 22:02:56
"The staff is pretty consistently good. There are a couple professors that people are rather polarized about, but the students are pretty understanding even of those professors that they dislike--no one every says that a professor is terrible, just that their teaching style doesn't mesh well with that student's learning style. Which isn't a euphemism, from what I've seen. There's a pretty wide range of teaching styles in the Reed physics department, but none of them are generally bad.

The accessibility of the professors depends on the professor. A few are in their office seemingly all the time, and frequently leave their doors open (door open = ok to bother them, usually). There are a couple that are more strict and limited in terms of office hours, but they usually still keep some hours reserved for homework helping, and also respond well enough to requests for appointments.

I've always found it super easy to get help on homework. The DoJo has tutoring regularly, and most professors have office hours as described above. Older physics students are also pretty good resources, so it's good to figure out where/when they tend to hang out. By junior year, most of us have formed study groups out of our physics friends, so we go over homework together while we do it and generally save each other's butts on stupid algebra mistakes.

Research opportunities are not plentiful, unfortunately. Most professors took on one or two juniors (well, they'll be seniors in two weeks) for research this summer, but that's not very many considering that our junior class has 26 students. They highly encourage you to apply for REUs elsewhere.",LeiaShadow,2012-04-29 00:44:54
"Sorry I missed this! I endorse LeiaShadow's review.

In particular, I agree that there's a range of teaching styles -- but quality-wise, the best of the physics professors are brilliant. They're focused on teaching more than on their own research, and they're really fantastic teachers.

But that does mean there's not as much research here as you'd find at a larger university. Not none -- everyone does a senior thesis, frequently an experimental one, and even before that some students get involved with professors' research, over the summer or during the year. But in general, research isn't as big a part of life for most students until their senior year, unless they do REUs or similar.",etaoin,2012-05-02 11:43:13
"As far as I know the LGBT (LettuceGuacamoleBaconandTomato) community at Reed is small as you would expect at such a small school but thriving. My physics major friends seem to like Physics, but I couldn't imagine doing that much complex math all the time.",bsonk,2012-04-29 13:02:46
"""The Yakama, the Umatilla, and other tribes across the US and Canada are fighting the expansion of fossil fuel extraction that threatens their health and their land. This is an industry that Reed College has tens of millions of dollars invested in. There is something deeply wrong when our community is comfortable mocking the indigenous while helping to finance their genocide.""

One person a 5 years ago wore a headress, the newspaper printed a picture of it, and suddenly we're talking about our school LITERALLY FUNDING GENOCIDE. wtf?",hatryd,2013-11-23 11:58:28
"The point is that Reed is engaged in activities that are oppressive to Native Americans at multiple different levels, and that these are all interconnected and part of the same racist culture. Not only did a student find it acceptable to wear a racist costume, but the college magazine found it acceptable to publish this image. And not only are we, as a community, comfortable perpetuating racist stereotypes, but we are actively investing tens of millions of dollars in an industry that is actively poisoning indigenous communities, which is the latest episode in a 500 year old history of genocide in this hemisphere. And not only is this happening in a general sense, but it is happening locally--the very tribes that were displaced from the land the Reed College sits on top of are now being threatened by the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure.",kayamfermy,2013-11-23 14:52:16
"Do you have any evidence for the claim that Reed College is actively investing tens of millions of dollars fossil fuel extraction? Are you talking about investments made with our endowment?

",hatryd,2013-11-23 15:46:07
"Yeah, I'm talking about the endowment. Reed's financial reports are publicly available, and disclose a diversified portfolio of around $500,000,000. A diversified portfolio is likely to have between 5%-10% exposure to the fossil fuel industry, with an upwards bias because of the industry's good financial performance. These numbers have been casually confirmed by the schools treasurer, Ed McFarlane, and I invite anyone interested to personally confirm this with him by email. The Board of Trustees has refused to disclose its specific holdings.",kayamfermy,2013-11-23 17:52:40
"I do not think that Reed ""actively invests"" tens of millions of our dollars in the fossil fuel industry that is ""actively poisoning indigenous communities"" and furthermore I think that those statements are slanderous at best. That being said - I do not believe that Reed owns individuals equities in its portfolio nor do I believe that Reed would be able to influence a fund that it invests in to divest from the fossil fuel industry. 

That being said though, can you perhaps supply proof of the fact that Reed is ""actively investing tens of millions of dollars in an industry that is actively poisoning indigenous communities""? I would be more than happy to change my opinion on the matter if you are correct and have valid proof in this instance.",ReedCanyon,2013-11-29 14:57:48
"I cannot prove this to you, because the Board of Trustees refuses to divulge specific information regarding its investments. My response to hatyrd above outlines the logic involved in coming up with these numbers. Again, these numbers have been casually confirmed by Ed McFarlane, the treasurer, and if you email him yourself, he will confirm them. You're also right that Reed does not have any direct equity investments. It seems to me, though, that there is little effective difference in direct investment and an investment mediated by a middleman. Reed invests tens of millions of dollars in companies like Shell, BP, etc, and these companies use that money to finance their projects of extraction. This includes the development of fracking wells on [indigenous lands](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/new-brunswick-fracking-protests) and [public parks](http://www.npca.org/about-us/center-for-park-research/fracking/) throughout this country and Canada, although I should point out that there are a hell of a lot of non-indigenous citizens who are being poisoned by these wells, too. We could also talk about the shipment of coal along the Columbia River, whose particulate blowoff [violates the Columbia River Treaty](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/08/16/quinault-nation-passes-resolution-oppose-coal-exports-150911).",kayamfermy,2013-11-29 18:56:25
"While I'm generally against cultural appropriation and all that, and I don't mean to act as an apologist -- I have a few questions about the context of this image. 

Are we sure that this fellow was mimicking Native North Americans / First Nation people with his headdress, and not a South American / Latin American tradition?  And what are his own cultural origins? Is it impossible that he was drawing his costume from a cultural tradition he is thoroughly enmeshed with that has a long tradition of using feathers?  ",mimrm,2013-11-23 12:44:29
I refer you to a classic: http://nativeappropriations.com/2010/04/but-why-cant-i-wear-a-hipster-headdress.html,kayamfermy,2013-11-23 14:53:32

The context isn't described in this article nor the original one about RKSK. I'm asking for the context.",mimrm,2013-11-23 21:19:48
"It's certainly possible, but the much more likely explanation is that this Reedie went to the costume store in preparation for the party, and dismissing the critique for want of certainty is missing the point. It seems incredibly unlikely to me that a Native American Reedie would decide to bust out the sacred headdress of their culture, reserved for ritual purposes to party out with RKSK. It's possible, but even if! Even if this were the case, the publication of the picture without an explanation of that circumstance still represents an episode in a history of racist representation.",kayamfermy,2013-11-23 21:35:14
