"Update:  I am now in email contact with the best man for this happy couple.  I verified that this is accurate  through his FB.  The gal in the photo did say yes, and the best man plans to give them this photo as a wedding gift.  Thank you for all the people who reposted this and to the person who made the connection happen.  Thank you.  Keep on rockin in the free world, all of you!       

Update 2: The best man and I spoke via phone today. Due to the incredible response to this post, he decided to tell the couple about the photo and they are thrilled! I learned that they are active in their local community and are planning to use their honeymoon as an opportunity to do charity work overseas. In light of the overwhelming interest on Reddit and Imgur, they created a gofundme account to potentially generate contributions to their cause. I don't want the magic diminished by appearing to solicit money, but I do want to use the interest piqued by this story to make a positive impact in the offline world. I will be donating and I hope you do too.  Nevertheless, thank you all for helping this photo find it's way home.  We provided an incredible memory to a couple, who fortunately, are totally deserving of it.

It's a kickstarter to raise more capital- the items on every kick starter I've seen are priced higher than what their retail value is- because you're not just paying for the item- you're paying to help the company grow.,Windhorse730,2015-02-03 08:35:52
"&gt; items on every kick starter I've seen are priced higher than what their retail value is

That's been exactly the opposite of my experience. Everything I've backed is giving you a discount on the product because you're paying them up front for it. 

&gt; you're paying to help the company grow

No, you're not. You're helping them be cash flow positive during manufacturing. Most Kickstarters are selling products at cost and forgoing margins. 

Why? Product in the hands of consumers creates word of mouth marketing, which is generally more effective than shiny advertising. ",UseWhatName,2015-02-03 12:17:51

"I lived in Florida for a few years ago. I worked in a factory with just under one hundred employees. We didn't have any recycle bins in the whole place, except for a couple of huge bins outside for scrap steel and copper because we could get good $ for those at the recycling center and the owner was absolutely anal about making sure we recycled every ounce of copper or steel. 

I complained repeatedly about not having bins for glass, aluminum, and paper, and nothing happened. I went to HR and I was told that they asked the sanitation company for recycling bins but they wouldn't give them for free and charged like $5 per bin so the company wouldn't pay for it. 

This company was *thriving* and rapidly expanding and had net revenue of several million per year-the owner had a beachfront house, a yacht, and a collection of classic cars, but they wouldn't spend $50 to make sure we had recycling bins. It was disgraceful. 

Me and another employee brought in our own bins and took turns bringing the recyclables home to put in our own bins at home. A few of the employees were grateful and encouraged us, but even more thought we were idiots and liked to crack jokes about us stealing the company trash. 

Our residential service also sucked--we got a massive rolling bin for trash and they picked it up twice per week, but we only got one small bin for all mixed recyclables and they only picked it up every other week. Our recycling was always overflowing and we'd have to put out extra boxes, but we only needed to take the trash once per week, it was stupid. ",night_owl,2014-04-26 11:48:44

"Rip City, as a term, was coined by former Blazers announcer Bill Schonely.  He was the play-by-play announcer for many, many years, and had several hallmark phrases that he used when exciting things happened.  He first used the term while calling a 1970 game against the Lakers, when the Blazers had pulled up from a heavy point deficit and taken the lead on a long jump shot.  ""Rip City!  All right!"" was Bill's cry, and it stuck.  He's later said that it had no meaning and was just a blurted out phrase of excitement. ",Osiris32,2014-04-26 07:47:29

Welcome to the world of Nickel and Sulphur mining...and with the current administration of Canada and Australia it looks like things are getting worse. Yay when money trumps everything else...

So sure they give out less emissions as pickup trucks that people like to drive but they still fuck up mother nature in many ways.

What's also sad about the PNW is the sheer amount of fucking SUVs people drive around. I've lived in 4 cities now and I don't think I've seen as many SUVs in those than I have seen here in Portland. And most of them aren't being used by families or anything, it's usually a single person (oddly enough usually a woman too) that drive them around.

"Oh I completely agree. But there are people like that everywhere, even here in Oregon.

And I think a lot of the blame actually lies with the previous generation. A lot of our problems with environment, with the way our cities are designed, our lack of public transportation, our debt all have their roots on a generation who had things that were way too good to be true and never thought about the consequences. 

Sure initially they didn't have the scientific knowledge to understand a lot of things, but even when that knowledge became available they didn't care. While most countries around the world were understanding the need of public transportation back in like the 70s and spending billions over the years to get their infrastructure up and running...what did America do? Oh we let lobbyists determine our way of life and we built our life around pandering to them.

And its not like things have changed. We still keep pandering to lobbying...like for example the lovely ethanol in our fuel. Does that 10% ethanol reduce the cost of our gasoline? Nope. Does it increase gas mileage? Nope in fact it reduces it by 10-15%. Does it reduce emissions? Nope they're exactly the same. So why do we still use it? Because we feel the need to waste billions of dollars a year propping up a failing industry. And that's not including all the other shit that goes into ethanol production.

E85 does have emission benefits but with the amount of energy that goes into it's production its pretty controversial if total emissions are reduced or not . E10 has been proven constantly to have no real benefit.

One thing that I always found odd is that in the midwest, and many other parts of America, you can a lot of gas stations that will sell you 0% ethanol and/or E85. But it's almost impossible to find E85 or pure gas here in Oregon and I'm not sure why.",cookies981,2014-04-26 21:56:20

"&gt;But, then again, that last bit is common to many cities.

Now this is anecdotal evidence but I have lived in 5 cities during my life and while there are bad drivers in every cities I feel like Portland has had the worst of them. Now one good thing is there aren't many asshole drivers, other cities had a ton more, but there are people who are just clueless as to what to do when things aren't perfect. 

Portland also seems to have an abundance of courteous drivers. Sure that's  a good thing but road rules still have to be followed. Don't just stop in the middle of the road for no reason to let a car in the turn lane through, don't get to a stop sign and go ""no you first"". The rules exist for a reason, they protect everyone and it makes you predictable. Being courteous and clueless makes you unpredictable and makes things worse.

Asshole drivers, on the other hand, tend to be fairly predictable. They are in no means a good driver and they usually delay everyone, including themselves, but you can at least tell that they're an asshole and when they're going to pull in just by watching the way their car drives.

I do wish Portland had more highway driving laws like left lane is for overtaking only, slower cars keep right and for the love of god make trucks stay in the right lane only unless they're overtaking. At least once a day I get stuck behind two trucks who have blocked both lanes and are going their speedlimit which is lower than the cars speed limit.",cookies981,2014-08-18 20:51:43

Awesome post! How would someone get started learning about mushrooms and mushroom hunting? What are some good resources!,40Cows,2014-11-23 21:05:08
"Two general types of experience you can get: hands-on, and book learning.

The former is very important, but not too difficult to do.  A fair number of people in the Portland area go mushroom hunting occasionally, even if they only know a species of two.  Sucking up to the right people is surprisingly effective.  Also, getting in touch with or joining organizations like [Oregon Mycological Society](http://wildmushrooms.org/) or the [Cascade Mycological Society](http://cascademyco.org/) can be immensely helpful in making contacts and finding hunting partners/mentors.

The latter is also very important, as there is some much you can learn without actually holding a mushroom in your hands.  For books, accessible guides like [Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest](http://www.amazon.com/Mushrooms-Pacific-Northwest-Timber-Guides/dp/0881929352/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416810364&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mushrooms+of+the+pacific+northwest) and [All That the Rain promises and More](http://www.amazon.com/All-That-Rain-Promises-More/dp/0898153883/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416810469&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=mushrooms+of+the+pacific+northwest) are great for getting started, and heftier books like [Mushrooms Demystified](http://www.amazon.com/Mushrooms-Demystified-David-Arora/dp/0898151694/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416810540&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mushrooms+demystified) are good for those looking to take the next step in learning.  Online, the [hunting and identification board on The Shroomery](http://www.shroomery.org/forums/postlist.php/Board/3), [Mushroom Observer](http://mushroomobserver.org/?_js=on&amp;_new=true), and /r/mycology are great places to lurk and just soak in info, while sites like [Mushroom Expert](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/) are good places to explore and follow what interests you.",tubergibbosum,2014-11-23 22:33:36

"Interesting about the Psilocybe cyanescens turning blue-green. When I did mushrooms, I was told that you could tell real 'shrooms from fake or poisonous ones because they turn blue when bruised.

I figured that was a wive's tale, but the fact that it is in the scientific names makes me think it is unique.Is that actually true or is there a poisonous lookalike that does the same?",bloodfist,2014-11-23 22:08:19
"Short answer: blue bruising does not guarantee psychoactivity, and lack of bruising does not preclude it.

Longer answer: it's complicated.  
While it's true that many of the popular psychedelic species bruise blue due to psilocin oxidation, like *[Psilocybe cubensis](http://www.shroomery.org/12500/Psilocybe-cubensis)* (which, if you've ever bought shrooms, is probably what you bought), *[P. cyanescens](http://www.shroomery.org/12501/Psilocybe-cyanescens)*, and *[P. azurescens](http://www.shroomery.org/12495/Psilocybe-azurescens)* do bruise blue, others, like *[P. semilanceata](http://www.shroomery.org/12510/Psilocybe-semilanceata)* and *[Panaeolus cinctulus](http://www.shroomery.org/12484/Panaeolus-cinctulus)*, bruise only weakly, if at all.  Complicating it further (for beginners, at least) are mushrooms totally unrelated to to the psychedelics like the [Red Cracking Bolete](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletus_chrysenteron.html), which bruises *strongly* blue, but whose bruising is due to different chemicals than psilocin, and others like [Witch's Cap](http://www.mushroomexpert.com/hygrocybe_conica.html) that bruise black, which may be mistaken for blue.  Also, some mushrooms [just are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stropharia_aeruginosa) blue-green.

So, I guess the tl;dr is that you ought to learn all the characteristics of a mushroom, and not just rely on bluing.",tubergibbosum,2014-11-23 23:07:12

1. Real cast iron will not hold up in a dishwasher. If you're feeling brave, try that and you'll know right away.

2. Cast iron is heavy. If it's light weight, it's fake.

3. Real cast iron commonly has a makers mark. Such as a logo, brand name, etc. If it's hard to see, try running it through the dishwasher to see if cleaning it makes the mark more visible.

4. Cast iron rusts easily. Putting it through a dishwasher will take care of that though!

5. If the handle isn't part of the original mold, it's fake.

6. Cast iron has an imperfect surface that's usually dark and dull, where as other pans are typically smooth and shiny. Running it through a dishwasher will make the surface of cast iron completely imperfect.

7. Also, if someone (a friend, roommate, or family member for example) tells you it's cast iron, it's probably cast iron. So don't put it in the dishwasher.",smilingfemalemachine,2014-11-24 20:06:17

The prospect of free drugs seems to cloud judgement sometimes.  It also seems to promote wishful thinking, making people rationalize away features of a mushroom they've found that don't match features of one they want to find.

Part of the problem is the time (and driving) it takes to gather, say, $20 worth of mushrooms, and all the times you come back empty. Also, it's very seasonal.  Finally there is competition with other gatherers, who can get very protective of their spots.  It's hard to find profitable locations (no serious hunters will share that with you), and unless you own the land, you can't keep others away if you do find one.

There's a few vendors at the PSU Farmer's Market (I'm sure other markets too) that sell wild mushrooms.  Perhaps chat with one of them next time you're there. If you just want to find someone to sell your hobby finds to, they might be able to help you.",DrippingGift,2014-11-24 10:25:06

"I do respect nature. But that doesn't mean you have to stay on some designated trail created by the city. You can venture off and as long as you don't throw trash on the ground or mess with any animals or fuck anything else up, you can still enjoy nature. I just don't understand people who think it's wrong to walk around in the woods if someone didn't already make a clear path for them to follow. Just silly. You can go to a large preserve area and what if there is no trail? You don't check it out? You watch from the outside and think ""Hey that's pretty neat but I'm gonna stay over here because I don't want to fuck it all up.""?  
That's boring.",fancy-ketchup,2014-11-24 17:47:27
"Walking off the trail erodes vegatation, the reason there are trails is to be able to see nature while destroying it as little as possible.   The more people wander off trails, the less pretty the area becomes too view.   

There is a reason every single park ranger will tell you to stay on the trail,  because if you don't you are helping ruin the experience for the next generation.

Trails are rarely made by ""the city""  by the way.  ",Gabaloo,2014-11-24 18:09:49
Do you seriously believe that one person walking around in the forest is destroying it? Have you ever gone backpacking or hiking? Or even camping?

"Do you seriously believe there is only one person going off trail?   Parks get thousands upon thousands of visitors every year,  all over the country.

I'm probably going to get slammed for this but at the end of the day I'm not sure if posts like this are really all that great of an idea. Even though everyone always says something along the lines of ""don't do this unless you know what you're doing."" Doesn't this post just make people who don't know what they're doing to go out and search for mushrooms?

I'm definitely in support of educating the public about mycology but I don't like the idea of uneducated groups of people trampling through the woods trying to find mushrooms and harming the ecosystem in the process because they don't exercise caution.

I can see someone whose posted something along the lines of, ""Can I turn this into a profitable hobby?"" To me, that's entirely the wrong way of looking at things.

"""Sex"" technically isn't the right term (I just used it for simplicity), rather ""mating type"".  Roughly speaking, one mating type can mate with any mating type that is different than it.  

Tom Volk has a good description of fungal hanky-panky [here](http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/feb2000.html), but I'll paraphrase.  Unlike humans, whose sex is determined by one chromosome, *Schizophyllum commune*'s mating types are determined by two genes called ""mating loci"", labeled A and B.  There are multiple possible alleles at each locus, meaning a haploid spore could be, for example, A7B3, meaning it has the 7th possible allele at locus A, and the third possible allele at locus B.  Two *S. commune* (and fungi with similar mating set ups) spores can mate only if they are different at *both* loci, meaning A7B3 could mate with A4B2, but not A4B3.  *S. commune* has over 300 possibles alleles at one locus, and 90 at the other, giving ~28,000 different combinations!",tubergibbosum,2014-11-24 13:52:35

"Some general advice from a gamer and former news editor:

- Get UGM Portland on the phone and see if they can wedge you into their PR. Right now they're leading with the KINK 101.9 donation on their website. Their last blog post was Nov. 5; no mention of PDXLAN anywhere at UGMportland.com. News media are going to listen to UGM before they listen to an independent group with little to no previous media relationship or contact.
- Volunteer. People on camera make better stories than food in a room, no matter how much it is. Get PDXLAN volunteers to UGM and help prep and serve. Hell, just get video of PDXLAN delivering the food. Don't worry about the quality, just get the shot.
- Don't wait for the media. Seriously. Especially don't wait for TV news--they don't have the staff to chase every story, and this is the wrong time of year to compete. Film it yourself, cut it yourself, post it to YouTube yourself, and send them the link to the footage. And links to unedited B-roll, and transcribe the audio for them. And write and send a proper press release, with everybody's names phonetically spelled out. Do all the work for them. Don't wait for them to do it because they won't do it if someone else comes up to them with the package practically ready to go. The worst-case scenario is you have a bunch of great stuff to post online and share just with your own community.
- Consider getting the media involved sooner. As in, start talking to them today about next year's PDXLAN.

OR

- Don't worry about the media. Focus on getting people into PDXLAN, focus on increasing engagement with the charity programs within your group, and fuck the media. You're doing it for charity, right? Then just do it for charity. Execute the charity well enough and coverage will follow--generally from the right places. Even if you got on the evening news, you can't make anyone who still watches it give a shit.",,2013-11-25 18:56:04

/u/trynewideas has some good ideas. I'll add a couple as a former news/production type. The main thing, I think, is to have some kind of hook. I think going with ""gamers aren't a bunch of bad people after all"" is kind of dated - when GTA sells 800 million bucks worth games on day one, the negative image of gamers is no longer a big deal. A strong visual hook with a couple of strong characters (or someone who plays against type... ""This Portland grandmother of 12 doesn't look like your typical gamer, but..."") is what the TV news will want.

"Wow...

Dude, major kudos to all of you for your hard, much needed work. You are each amazing! 

I can see wanting the media assistance to raise awareness and to bring in more donations but dude... it isn't needed. Just enjoy the good feeling, the profound help you are each giving. Who cares about the rest? Honestly, if you think that people really have such horrible labels and/or stereotypes about you all - who cares? Live your lives. A lot of people love,  appreciate, and understand you all. Media attention for a good deed is not needed, required,  nor should it be expected for doing something nice/volunteering.

"Is it possible that *part* of the problem may have been that the organization didn't have someone that knew how to deal with media, specifically how to properly format and submit a press release?

It's a big deal, the way most network news organizations run is rooted in some pretty old school and draconian processes and that's one of the reasons why a business, or a university, etc. will usually have someone trained to do such things, who has an established link with local outlets.

Having worked with a number of volunteer staffed NPOs before, and also having staffed senior positions myself at gaming events, fan conventions, and the like...I've definitely seen that sort of unfortunate communication breakdown happen before.

Please note I am NOT somehow defending the silly ways MSM behaves, or saying that once in a while you shouldn't expect them to just field a random phone call or e-mail and follow up on it with some effort (you know the whole *reporting* thing). I'm just saying hey, hopefully, maybe just maybe, at least with one of these stations, maybe that's what happened and it can still be fixed?

After all, this will continue to be a very relevant and timely story all the way through the next several days. Perhaps before we ready the pitchforks we should see who has the time and skills to potentially help?",trackofalljades,2013-11-25 22:15:42

Sad that I'm not surprised to see such backlash by this subred.   Charity has to compete with a lot more than the tug of a heart string or the soft voice to volunteer.  It has to get attention.  And in this day and age, being noticed is hard to do.  You have to petition, you have to advocate, you have to market.

"I was wondering when this would come back to me, and it's funny that it came back to me on this subreddit.   
Long story short:  My wife was and is quite the bibliophile.  She's one of those people whose living rooms are so filled with books that it is uncomfortable.  Starting the day we moved in with each other, I began to write one note per day and slip it within the pages of one of her many books.  She had literally over 5000 books when she unloaded the U-Haul, so I knew I could do this forever without her noticing.    
Sometimes they were simple ""I love you"" notes and sometimes they were sexual in nature and sometimes they were about specific instances.  One Thanksgiving I pulled out the green bean casserole from the oven and accidentally set it on a hot burner.  It exploded a few minutes later when we were upstairs with our infant son and almost set the whole house on fire.  My wife was really mad but I apologized in a little note and slipped it into her copy of ""Frommer's Brazil.""    
We ended up divorcing about 18 months ago, although technically it's not really official yet because I still have to sign some stuff.  I'm actually kind of surprised that she gave up ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and am wondering if she is okay since she liked that book so much.  Maybe she just got a new copy.   
I slipped the note in question into her book while she was off in Michiana visiting her parents (Michiana is the term they use for the South Bend/Kalamazoo area, I have learned).  It was the first--but definitely not the last--time that she flew away with my son and left me to my lonesome.    It's been kinda difficult lately.   
My only solace is that she will hopefully be finding these little love notes of mine for the rest of her life and feel as bad as I do when I'm seeing one on reddit.    
Good find.",oregone1,2013-03-31 23:30:22
Wow. Incredible story. Thank you,waka_flocculonodular,2013-04-02 23:44:09
"Well this is obviously a surprise to wake up to, so I best explain:   
Firstly, all of it's true, but with one important caveat.  This prank on my wife was not an original idea.  I originally got the idea from a book I read shortly after high school called [Sex and Sunsets](http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Sunsets-Novel-Tim-Sandlin/dp/B006CDINP8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365247648&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sex+and+sunsets) by Tim Sandlin.  It's centered around a character that is romantic in a borderline psychotic way, and the love-notes-in-books thing stuck with me somehow.  It's a quick read, and I recommend it, although I don't like anything else he's written.  
I do not remember writing that specific note, as I probably wrote well over a thousand over the course of our relationship.  The names are correct, and I can tell I've had a few beers in that one because of how the T is loopy.   
I thought I posted one of the notes on Facebook last September when I was cleaning up the house we lived in after she moved, but it's not there so I'm assuming I got embarrassed and deleted it.  I thought a screenshot of that would help.   
Most important (to me anyway), is that tensions have eased and I am being allowed nearly unrestricted time with my son.  Even got to go [camping](http://imgur.com/hvcTBC0) the other day, which is his new favorite thing to do.   
I don't know if my ex knows about the notes, and I'm not going to ask her for fear that the truce we have right now would be in jeopardy.  So please, internet sleuths, don't tell her okay?   
To whomever got me Reddit Gold, thanks very much.  I've never tried it so I'm looking forward to it.   
TL;DR   
Not fake, but not original either because everything I do comes from stupid books I read 20 years ago.",oregone1,2013-04-06 04:45:53
"I have a habit of using all sorts of random shit as a bookmark, and as a consequence, will often find ancient pieces of mail, plane tickets, and notes years later, even decades, long after I'd forgotten about doing it.  As I've borrowed plenty of books from significant others over the years, I'm sure that there are books with my random shit shoved in them all over the country by this point.  I've left notes similar to yours in their books from time to time, too, just to see when (and if) they would discover them.

Funny story; years ago me, my brother, and his wife were sharing an apartment.  One day she comes home and, after having a bad day at work, starts ranting about all the ""crap"" we'd left out in the kitchen, walking around pointing out everything she can see ""What's *this* crap?!  How about *this* crap??!!?  Why is ***THIS*** crap here?!?!!!!?!  Everywhere is ***CRAP***!!!!""

So, later that night I get a couple packs of post it notes and just start labeling everything CRAP.  All the shit in the cabinets, the dishes, inside her cookbooks...'crap' everywhere.  She's still finding notes with '**CRAP**' written on them to this day, and that was almost 10 years ago.  I even wrote CRAP on the little piece of paper thing for her crockpot that slips in the front to identify what's in there for pot-lucks and such...she didn't even notice (and nobody told her, of course) for a few times until finally, a couple years later, someone asks her what she brought in for the pot-luck, she examines the label that had been on there for years, and declares ""I guess it's crap..."" to the amusement of all.",angrydeuce,2013-04-06 06:08:14

"Keep doing it!

I recently purchased 30+ Robert Heinlein novels from a person on eBay, and one of my favorite things about reading a new book is I always find plane tickets from the 60s and 70s and scraps of paper with writing as a bookmark. I usually study each item and figure out as much as I can about the previous owner each time. 

I usually find this part just as enjoyable as the actual reading. ",IrNinjaBob,2013-04-06 18:24:22
"If youre working your way through them for the first time, try and read his early works first. Thats where the wonderful and boyish awe of space exists (especially his books that were published as serials in young mens magazines). His later works get political and he comes across as a perverted old man in some of them. Theyre all good books though! 

Enjoy them! Starship Troopers and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress were my favorites. :)",MrTinkels,2013-04-12 10:35:44
"I've been reading through Heinlein for a little while, and now I own the majority of his published work thank to that purchase. 

I also really love his juveniles for that awe of space and early sci-fi romanticism that make his work stand out. Citizen of the Galaxy is probably still one of my favorite, but followed closely by Have Space Suit -- Will Travel. 

I really enjoy a lot of his later work, too. Parts of Stranger in a Strange Land and Time Enough for Love have made me question certain social norms in a way I never had before, and no matter what I pick up I usually walk away satisfied. 

Farnham's Freehold and The Sixth Column are also good ones, the latter of which comes off as pretty racist today, but as long as you can get past the fact that it was written during a different time there are really fun themes.  

I'm excited to get through the rest of them. Do you have any other recommendations on what I should look at next? (The others I've already read are Starship Troopers, Double Star, Methuselah's Children, and I'm reading through The Door Into Summer now.)",IrNinjaBob,2013-04-12 14:50:27
"Rocketship Galileo was awesome (Think of a slightly more mature Have Spacesuit -- Will Travel.), along with Orphans of the Sky, Revolt in 2100, Between Planets, Space Cadet, and The Puppet Masters. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress should be at the top of your list though! I read that book when I was 13 and it made me cry in the middle of Geography class. Not really the best of ways to pick up the ladies, but it was a good book. 

I really enjoyed a lot of his books that were compilations of his short stories/novellas, like Revolt in 2100, etc.  Some of his bigger works (Stranger in a Strange Land, I'm looking at you) got too political for me when I read them. I'm pretty sure if I picked it back up now that I'm not 14 anymore I'd understand it better, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Heinlein is by far the best Sci-Fi writer I've come across. If you're really enjoying his works, look into Asimov and De Camp. They're both pretty good and all three of them worked in the shipyards in Philly together so you can see a lot of influence from all three blended into their works. Also, if you liked Starship Troopers for how futuristic and kind of.. actioney it was, pick up Old Man's War by John Scalzi. Shit was legit.",MrTinkels,2013-04-12 15:09:21
"Yeah, you describe Stranger in a Strange Land pretty accurately. It's been a few years since I've read it, but I really didn't click with some of the themes that emerged in the book. I barely have any recollection of the second half of the book because I started to lose interest, but specifically the first 100-120 pages or so I really enjoyed. Jubal Harshaw is a ridiculously hilarious character, and I enjoy the first half because Valentine Michael Smith is still more Martian than human. And the whole idea that a human has the potential to reach such a higher level of being, if only we knew how. Very enjoyable. 

I've heard a lot of good about The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I'll make sure I stop there next. 

I've read a few of Asimov's short stories, so I'm also looking forward getting around to his work (too much to read, too little time.) I'll probably start with the Foundation series and move my way around from there. I haven't gotten my hands on De Camp yet, so that will be fun to check out too. 

I've read Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigade, and I don't remember ever wishing our technology was on par with fiction more than that. That man knows how to tell a fun story. Red Shirts also looks like it is really good. 

Some of my other favorites are Larry Niven, Orson Scott Card, and Phillip Jose Farmer. Ringworld is an obvious choice, but my favorite of Niven's are The Integral Trees and its sequel, The Smoke Ring. Blew my mind even more than the idea of a ringworld. 

And Farmer's Riverworld series is an absolute can't miss. The way he blends history and science fiction is spectacular.

"That's not a reason to keep someone from their kid, unless they really actually present a danger to the child.",Tholsh,2013-04-06 12:41:46
"You argue to reason, which is the first thing to go out the window with parents. It's a very emotional experience, after all.

Look, you don't need to convince me. I just tried to give insight into why the question of how and by whom children should be raised is so hard to clear up when a relationship has gone downhill, even before actual malice factors into it.",ICanBeAnyone,2013-04-06 16:44:48
"I suppose that's true. I also am just making assumptions based on what I think would be the 'right' thing to do, never having actually felt the emotions of being a parent. Though I could totally see never leaving a kid alone with someone who is neglectful or untrustworthy.

 EugeneVictorTooms said 'who is obviously loved by the other parent,' though. If a mother/father keeps their kid away from the other parent in a situation like that, it seems to me that everyone is being done a disservice, especially the kid. It just seems to me, regardless of emotion, the kid should be every parents first priority in such a situation, and it's a real shame how often that isn't the case. 

I get it's probably insanely complicated, but I feel strongly that people should be decent to one another when it comes to custody of children. It should be incredibly rare that custody isn't shared as close to 50/50 as possible. Parents should never ever be looking for sole custody unless the child is being put in danger otherwise. So often when a parent goes after full custody, it has nothing to do with the child and everything to do with petty punishment toward a spouse.

 The whole thing seems terrible on the kids, but if the system doesn't change, then courts need to stop siding with the mother by default.

 For one, that makes for an incredibly unfair trial, and an uphill battle for any father whose ex wife decides to use their child to spite them. 

Second, I'm certain plenty of great fathers are barred from seeing their children more than one weekend a month, if at all. This isn't to say the same thing doesn't happen to mothers, as I'm sure it does. The system sets men up for this situation, however, by siding with the woman by default.

 Third, I can't even imagine the negative feelings this causes a child to have for a seemingly absent parent who, in reality, tried everything they possibly could to retain custody and failed for one non-parental reason or another; possibly even purposefully banned from visitation by the current guardian for no reason whatsoever other than a judges bias against fathers, or the poor performance of a lawyer, or any number of other reasons. It actually seems to cause the LESS responsible parent to monopolize time with a child who has a full set of loving parents.

Wow, sorry for the rant, I'm ripped.

TLDR: I get it, emotions cloud judgement. Loving parents barred from their kids is never a good thing. Kids should be priority one. Custody courts need to stop being biased against fathers. Should do everything possible to keep both parents involved. Parents need to stop fighting for sole custody unless the safety of the kid is in question.",Tholsh,2013-04-06 22:11:54
"Woah :) I agree, though I have to add the small caveat that the reason the courts came to default to the mother in the first place is that there is, or has been, a much larger percentage of fathers not much interested in child care after a divorce, or, as you said, using it as a stick in negotiations, or plain punishment. That's of course no comfort to a man who is not like that and is denied access to his children.

Thinking about this really drives the point home that you should pick your partners with great care, and not give them a reason to hate you. :|",ICanBeAnyone,2013-04-07 10:43:15

And, his second wife (of 20 years), was the one who introduced him to politics and gave him access to all of his artist friends (Pablo Picasso, for example). He actually avoided politics because he came from the poor, working class region/family.

But, he also stood by the side of his friend, Salvadore Allende--even when Pinochet's tanks were pointed at him.  He hid, was transported from safehouse to safehouse, for nearly a year before literally running through the jungles for his life (also from Pinochet)--writing every single day while doing so.

You also failed to mention that he was Ambassador for Chile to 15 different countries--including France and Mexico.  And, that the people elected him to the position of Senator for both his words and his politics.  Or, that his wealth came from book sales.

In the poem, the narrator deludes himself that he doesn't really love the woman who is gone--but, he wavers in his certainty, and ultimately tells us, the reader, that he still loves her.  

It seemed really appropriate for the OP in this case.  His descriptions of the woman to whom he wrote these hundreds of undiscovered love-notes are very sweet, and wistful.  There is a sadness in the OP's statements.  He wonders if she is doing alright--because he remembers the book in which he had hidden this particular note, as well as her connection to that book--and, wonders if she is doing okay.

Some people think that poetry is worthless--simply because it doesn't have a cash value in American society.  Perhaps those people should read that poem a few times.  A couple of times slowly, and then aloud.

Orwell got it really right with the idea of Newspeak and how you can manipulate the conversations people have by changing the definitions of things.

Having said that, you obviously do have a right to question someone's honesty if you have a good reason to think they're lying. Is that what you're suggesting here? That giraffe_legs is lying?",citizenfaith,2013-04-06 01:16:55
"Nope, I wasn't saying he was lying.

I was merely saying that I believe he redefined the word ""beautiful"" to help cope with the lack of beauty he finds in the world. In the same way that many of us redefine our failures or painful experiences as things that helped us become the person we are today. Sure, sometimes failing can bring about a positive change in someone's life, but many times it doesn't. Many times it just reinforces bad behavior. We choose to ignore those examples and tell ourselves a story instead.

&gt;You don't get to do that; beauty is subjective.

I realize that I'm pretty alone in this belief (especially amongst my artist friends), but I don't believe beauty is fundamentally subjective. It may be hard (read as: practically impossible) for us to see the objective view of it in all cases, but that doesn't mean it isn't there.

There is a real difference between Led Zeppelin and the FreeCreditReport.com band. No matter how many people tell me that beauty is subjective, I'm positive that there is an essential difference between the two in respect to their objective beauty. Many of my artist friends adamantly disagree. I've had long arguments where they profess to believe that Justin Bieber and Pink Floyd are essentially equivalent artistically because there is no real objective definition of beauty. The fact that we can find evolutionary reasons for many of the things we find beautiful seems to back this up.",kabbotta,2013-04-06 01:46:49
"I don't really get it to be honest. It sounds like you're saying he misused the word ""beautiful"" or perhaps he was lying to himself about his own feelings?

Those both seem like pretty bold claims. Can't he just have found something sad to be beautiful? [Have you never found anything sad to be beautiful?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1aLgfKCgd4) 

I get your point about Led Zeppelin vs the FreeCreditReport.com band and one clearly being better than the other. I think there are lots of objective standards you could use to distinguish the two; artistry, complexity, originality, motivation etc. But if person X honestly says they find the music of the FreeCreditReport.com band to be more beautiful than the music of Led Zeppelin then you just have to accept that. You might think they're a complete weirdo, but you can't just tell them they're misusing the word or lying to themselves - beauty doesn't work like that.",citizenfaith,2013-04-06 02:07:12
"&gt;But if person X honestly says they find the music of the FreeCreditReport.com band to be more beautiful than the music of Led Zeppelin then you just have to accept that.

I have to accept that I can't morally try to force them to change their ways. But, in the same sense that we can tell religious groups that the way they treat women is wrong, I believe we can say that Led Zeppelin did create more beautiful music than the FreeCreditReport.com band. I don't see why I have to accept words being redefined. It's immoral to treat women that way, it doesn't matter [what they believe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3peXdSkx44). 

I see the two in the same light. The word beauty means something that we can reasonably talk about objectively. It's definition is not ""whatever someone wants to call beautiful"". None of that stops me from accepting that Radiohead and Ella Fitzgerald may be two essentially equal peaks on the landscape of beauty (mercilessly stealing from Sam Harris right now). So, it's not that different tastes can't exist. It's just that there are lines we can draw based solely on the definition of the word. 

Drowning your children in the tub is not beautiful. There, we've set an objective bar that *almost* everybody would agree to. From that point it's just the details we have left ; )",kabbotta,2013-04-07 12:03:03
"&gt;Drowning your children in the tub is not beautiful.

Well of course I don't think it's beautiful, and you'd be hard pushed to find anyone who does. That doesn't make it an *objective* bar though. It's just that we all happen to agree on a subjective thing. Having said that, it's not logically impossible that we could find one persons who did think it was beautiful, and, of course, it would be perfectly right to suggest that such a person was deranged and that their experience of beauty was fundamentally warped, but it wouldn't make sense to say they were mistaken about their own experience, and didn't really think it was beautiful.

I also agree the definition of beauty is not ""whatever someone wants to call beautiful"" because then it is effectively meaningless. Beauty is whatever anyone honestly *experiences* as beautiful. You can influence someone's experience of beauty. You can reveal information which makes something that they previously found ugly seem beautiful, or vice versa, but beauty is still an experience. Experience is the very definition of subjective so it simply doesn't make sense to treat beauty as if it were objective

Consider this analogy: I put my hand in a bucket of ice cold water and simultaneously you put your hand in a bucket of near-scalding hot water. After a minute, we both take our hands out and put them together in a third bucket of room-temperature water. On my hand the water will feel warm, but on your hand the same water will feel cool. Now, we can meaningfully argue about what temperature the water actually is. We can take a thermometer and check and even agree that objectively the water is room-temperature. However, we cannot meaningfully disagree about the temperature that the water *feels*. To me it feels warm, and no matter how many times you tell me it feels cold or show me the measurement on the thermometers it will still feel warm to me because the *feel* of the water is a subjective, experiential phenomenon; the feel of the water is entirely inside my head.

You're trying to treat the beauty of a story like the measurable temperature of the water, but beauty is not like that; beauty is like the feel of the water and you can't disagree with what someone else feels.

"&gt;but it wouldn't make sense to say they were mistaken about their own experience, and didn't really think it was beautiful.

Yes, exactly. They can *think* it's beautiful all they want. They certainly have that right, but that doesn't change the definition. It doesn't make drowning children in the tub beautiful. It just makes them wrong about the definition of beautiful ; )

Would you argue that there is no such thing as an objective view of health since it shares many of the defining characteristics of beauty?

The concepts of circumference, circle and diameter are not related to our experience or perception.

You can see that this is true by the fact that the definition of ""pi"" makes no reference to experience or perception.

The definition of beauty will always directly reference experience however, which is quite different to being tangentially related to experience.

I don't know if this will just confuse things, but the difference between *a priori* knowledge and *a posteriori* knowledge (to use the philosophical terms) may be useful here. 

Knowledge of pi is *a priori* i.e. independent of experience. Once I have enough understanding of the world to understand basic concepts like circle, circumference and diameter, I don't need any further experience to understand the concept of pi. My knowledge of pi is not dependent on experience of pi; I can come to it through reason alone.

My understanding of beauty, on the other hand, is *a posterioir* i.e. it is dependent on my experience of beauty. There is no amount of other concepts I could understand which would lead me to understand beauty unless I have experienced beauty myself. 

So knowledge of beauty is *a posteriori* as it cannot be gained through reason alone. 

Perhaps this helps make sense of the claim that beauty is inherently subjective because it cannot be defined without directly referencing experience and perception?

If you're not happy with that last claim though, just put it aside for a moment. Assume that it is possible to give a supposedly objective definition of beauty. We run into trouble immediately anyway, because how will we agree on what that definition should be? How could you argue that your definition was the right one? Will we have some judge?

That's a good point, that I agree with, but it doesn't mean there isn't an objective standard of beauty. In the same way that the revolutions of modern physics do not mean there is no objective underlying reality. It just means our perspective of that reality has expanded or shifted. We don't need to worry about *who* will decide what the definition of beauty is. The main purpose of science is to let nature decide who is right.

It just means our understanding of that objective definition is constantly updating itself with new understanding and input. The same is true of our experience of beauty. 

That story about the monks climbing around the elephant and each describing it differently is a good example of this idea. Beauty, the elephant in this example, is still really there and physical, but different people are looking at it from different perspectives and thinking they are seeing the whole picture. Just like with the monks, we are blind. It may be practically impossible for us to ever see the whole elephant. But we can still infer that something like it exists by comparing notes from our limited perspectives of it. Obviously, this is a limited analogy since I don't think nature necessarily has a mind like an elephant, but hey, an analogy is an analogy. Never perfect.

If beauty was truly subjective then there would be no significant correlations between what people found beautiful-there would be no elephant under it all.  Instead, there are strong connections due to the underlying structures that create a desire for beautiful things. The fact that almost no one describes torture (forced, not voluntary abuse) as beautiful is a reflection that there is some structure giving rise to a definition of what humans will find beautiful. 

&gt;There is no amount of other concepts I could understand which would lead me to understand beauty unless I have experienced beauty myself. 

But this is true of your experience of pi as well. You can not come to it through reason alone. You can experience the fact that a circle's diameter is proportional to its radius to a certain degree, but that is different from ""why"" it is true, or its physical origins. You can only come to an abstraction of pi by reason alone. Experience is required to validate that abstraction. Experience often referred to experiment in science. 

Both pi and beauty are abstract concepts reflecting our understanding of a reality that appears impossible to experience directly. The reality or the ""true"" physical nature of pi is just as removed from you as the nature of beauty. That doesn't mean it's not there, and we have good reasons to believe it is there in both cases. That is, some underlying structure to what is beautiful and what gives rise to the mathematical objects we find in nature.

"So I take it you disagree with the claim that beauty is an experience? You would say it's more like the temperature of the water than the feel of the water?

I fundamentally disagree with that. You're trying to tie the definition of beauty to the common understanding of beauty, but many subjective views taken together are still subjective. 

I say every experience of beauty is equally valid, you say only the most popular view of beauty is the right one, but if beauty is defined purely be popular opinion then whatever is popularly thought of as beautiful, is beautiful. That's completely subject to change and the whims of the people so cannot be an objective standard. You've simply substituted an individual subjective viewpoint for the sum of multiple subjective viewpoints.

I don't accept the analogy with science at all. Science is moving in a particular direction and each revolution brings us closer to the truth. We thought the earth was was the centre of the universe, then we thought it was the sun, now we know that there are many stars and no 'centre' of the universe as such. We were still wrong when we thought the sun was the centre, but we were closer to the truth than before. The change in our understanding of beauty is not like that at all. The popular conception of beauty in the renaissance period wasn't incorrect, and the one we have now isn't any better. What possible grounds could you have for saying one conception of beauty is better than another when all that counts is which conception is the most popular at the time?

Can I ask if there is anything you think is subjective?

Let's take an example I think of as obviously subjective: the taste of food.

There clearly is an underlying reality that the taste of food represents as food has a chemical composition which can be analysed in some detail. There is also a significant correlation between what people find tasty. Almost everyone finds strawberries tasty, almost nobody finds lemons tasty.

However, that doesn't mean there is an objective standard which we can use to judge tastiness. If we were to find one person who honestly found lemons tasty and didn't find strawberries tasty, it would be nonsensical to say they were wrong about that. It is their own subjective experience they are describing when they tell us what is and isn't tasty - they can't be wrong about that.

Beauty is much more like the taste of food than it is like science. There is a significant correlation in what people find beautiful and also in what people find tasty, but both things are purely experiences.

Even if you don't accept any of this, surely you would agree that you personally don't have perfect knowledge of what is currently the most common concept of beauty? You can only have your own personal everyday experience of what people do and do not consider beautiful and this is unlikely to be representative of humanity as a whole. As such, even if you think that beauty is objective, you still shouldn't be going around correcting people when they say a story is beautiful because that person probably has just as good an understanding of the common concept of beauty as you.

I fundamentally disagree with that. You're trying to tie the definition of beauty to the common understanding of beauty, but many subjective views taken together are still subjective. 

I say every experience of beauty is equally valid, you say only the most popular view of beauty is the right one, but if beauty is defined purely be popular opinion then whatever is popularly thought of as beautiful, is beautiful. That's completely subject to change and the whims of the people so cannot be an objective standard. You've simply substituted an individual subjective viewpoint for the sum of multiple subjective viewpoints.

I don't accept the analogy with science at all. Science is moving in a particular direction and each revolution brings us closer to the truth. We thought the earth was was the centre of the universe, then we thought it was the sun, now we know that there are many stars and no 'centre' of the universe as such. We were still wrong when we thought the sun was the centre, but we were closer to the truth than before. The change in our understanding of beauty is not like that at all. The popular conception of beauty in the renaissance period wasn't incorrect, and the one we have now isn't any better. What possible grounds could you have for saying one conception of beauty is better than another when all that counts is which conception is the most popular at the time?

Can I ask if there is anything you think is subjective?

Let's take an example I think of as obviously subjective: the taste of food.

There clearly is an underlying reality that the taste of food represents as food has a chemical composition which can be analysed in some detail. There is also a significant correlation between what people find tasty. Almost everyone finds strawberries tasty, almost nobody finds lemons tasty.

However, that doesn't mean there is an objective standard which we can use to judge tastiness. If we were to find one person who honestly found lemons tasty and didn't find strawberries tasty, it would be nonsensical to say they were wrong about that. It is their own subjective experience they are describing when they tell us what is and isn't tasty - they can't be wrong about that.

Beauty is much more like the taste of food than it is like science. There is a significant correlation in what people find beautiful and also in what people find tasty, but both things are purely experiences.

Even if you don't accept any of this, surely you would agree that you personally don't have perfect knowledge of what is currently the most common concept of beauty? You can only have your own personal everyday experience of what people do and do not consider beautiful and this is unlikely to be representative of humanity as a whole. As such, even if you think that beauty is objective, you still shouldn't be going around correcting people when they say a story is beautiful because that person probably has just as good an understanding of the common concept of beauty as you.

"&gt;You've simply substituted an individual subjective viewpoint for the sum of multiple subjective viewpoints.

I think you can read what I've commented and realize this is not true. If that's the impression I gave then the failure is one of communication and not ideas.

&gt;Can I ask if there is anything you think is subjective?
&gt;Let's take an example I think of as obviously subjective: the taste of food.

Yes, I think one individual's interpretations and feelings about the world are subjective. But, just like light and all other physical phenomenon, I think that ""taste"" is fundamentally an objective experience. Whether or not we will ever be able to put together a language of concepts to describe taste the way we describe the electro-magnetic force is something that I see as a separate question. Our experience of taste, individually, is subjective, but the fact that more than 99.99% of people find the taste of dirt to be less appealing than a ripe strawberry is excellent evidence for an objective reality of taste. *Or, at least, a simulation that is quite convincing.*

&gt;*Beautiful – Of a very high standard. Excellent.*

I'll be the first to admit that I've avoided an actual definition until now since it can be a distraction, but I think it does clarify something. The concept of ""beauty"" is connected to a high standard of what is good. ""Beautiful"" does not mean what ""interesting"" or ""intriguing"" means. Hitler killing 6 million Jews is interesting. You want to know how the fuck some guy gets away with that. But it's not beautiful just because it is intricately designed or well-thought out and appreciated by some.

&gt;You would say it's more like the temperature of the water than the feel of the water?

No, I agree with you. Beauty is like the feel of the water. But the feel of the water appears to be an objective reality according to everything we've discovered. It includes the temperature, pressure, and whatever other physical interactions that are related to the process of feeling water (i.e. memory or physiological reactions). Even if we can't yet fully express or explain that reality, it is still quite acceptable to acknowledge there is good reason to believe it exists. At least, in physics it is acceptable. In sociology, philosophy, and art it seems like they resist this result.

&gt;I don't accept the analogy with science at all. Science is moving in a particular direction and each revolution brings us closer to the truth.

This is also true for beauty or aesthetic in my opinion.  In ancient times, we found things like sacrifice or torture to be acceptable entertainment on a large scale. We found bloodsport to be an intriguing and socially acceptable past-time. We thought the image of God condemning women to painful childbirth due to their inherent weakness of curiosity was a beautiful story. A story that should be told to children, it was so beautiful.

We've changed in our aesthetic preferences, and its been an improvement, not just a random walk. That doesn't mean ancient people never accomplished anything beautiful. In the same way that it doesn't mean Newton was a failure just because Einstein proved him wrong. The beauty of a scientific perspective is that both Newton and Einstein can be seen as equally important pioneers even though one eventually trumped the other. In the same way, an early cave painter can be seen as equally important even if the work of Da Vinci is greatly refined and focused compared to the cave painter's work. If you don't think we are moving forward somehow, then what are we all doing here?

We have matured in our appreciation for both beauty and physics. If there was no objective beauty to appreciate then this would not have been possible. Instead, you could only say that we have a view of beauty now, and they had a view of beauty back then. If you believe that beauty is subjective, then you have to say, if you're being honest, that they are essentially equivalent. A man who thinks that a sexual relationship with an infant is beautiful, Mohammad of the Islamic faith for instance, has no less claim to the term than a woman who thinks that beauty is only found in kindness and compassion to others.

I think if you take this extreme example, you'll realize you accept an objective view of beauty as well. I never said the boundaries of what is beautiful were clear to us. I'm not sure they ever will be. And I never said beauty couldn't have many equivalent forms. None of that prevents or persuades us to believe it is a fundamentally subjective term.",kabbotta,2013-04-10 02:24:23

&gt;it is not the experiences themselves that are beautiful but the contrast in between the highs and lows that we call our life.

Are you saying that having a healthy newborn child is only beautiful when compared to terrible things? I don't believe this for a second.

This is where we disagree. If I told you there was an alien race that could steal your favorite childhood memories and replace them with traumatic and painful ones, I don't think you would have any problem telling me that wouldn't be good even if no one has ever experienced it.

&gt;The beauty I was speaking of isn't in one act of evil or one act of good, but instead in the process of life itself.

And that process includes things like genocide and infanticide. If you use the word 'beautiful' to encompass all of that then the word loses it's meaning for me. When someone says they find a certain beauty in sadness or depression, I believe they are just looking for a silver lining to help them cope.

You mean because elected judges have to keep an eye on public opinion to make sure they get re-elected?  Not really an issue for McShane.  If you're familiar with Multnomah County, then you know that it is almost unheard of for any MultCo judge to run opposed.

"&gt; That's not ""fixing the law"" at all, that's anarcho-capitalism applied to marriage.

do you just like using big words to make yourself seem more intelligent?

when monogomous couples enter into marriage they already agree to this prenup, except that prenup is a default setup that exists in the law across other statutes. all i'm saying is if for some reason you believe that the law is unable to handle polygamy, you can condition the isuance of a polygamy license on the parties making this agreement explicit. this isn't a band-aid, it's in fact how most private contractual relationships work (the law is a default, parties can modify and can be forced to decide things as a condition of a legal recognition) 

another, 30-seconds-off-the-top-of-my-head solution would be to require polygamous couples to exist in a community property state-of-affairs whereupon divorce by any of the parties causes all community assets to be split x (the number of people) ways. 

this is incidentally exactly what happens when parties who hold property jointly can't agree on what happens when one party wants to divest themselves of it.

"&gt;That polygyny is bad for women is not necessarily intuitive. As economist Robert H. Frank has pointed out women in polygynist marriages should have more power because they’re in greater demand, and men should wind up changing more diapers. But historically, polygamy has proved to be yet another setup that screws the XX set. Because there are never enough of them to go around, they wind up being married off younger. Brothers and fathers, realizing how valuable their female relations are, tend to control them more. And, as one would expect, polygynous households foster jealousy and conflict among co-wives. Ethnographic surveys of 69 polygamous cultures “reveals no case where co-wife relations could be described as harmonious,” Henrich writes, with what must be a good dose of understatement.

&gt;Children, too, appear to suffer in polygamous cultures. Henrich examines a study comparing 19th-century Mormon households, 45 of them headed by wealthy men, generally with multiple wives, and 45 headed by poorer men, generally with one wife each. What’s surprising is that the children of the poorer men actually fared better, proving more likely to survive to age 15. Granted, this is a small study, but it’s consistent with other studies, including one from Africa showing that the children of monogamous households tend to do better than those from polygynous households in the same communities. Why? Some scholars suspect that polygyny may discourage paternal investment. Men with lots of children and wives are spread too thin, and to make things worse, they’re compiling resources to attract their next wives instead of using it on their existing families.

http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/01/the_problem_with_polygamy.html

&gt;Invariably in societies that have practiced polygyny for generations, men have instituted ways to prevent women from capturing their market value. Markets for wives are far from free. Polygynous societies frequently have arranged marriages leading to large age gaps between husbands and wives and a high likelihood of early widowhood. A ""bride price"" is often found in these societies: instead of women capturing their own market value, husbands-to-be make monetary payments prior to marriage to the brides' guardians. Men can easily obtain a divorce, and the threat of it keeps women in line. Child custody almost always is the right of the father. Women are often isolated. As beautiful as the harem in Grenada's Alhambra is, the institution is typical of polygamous societies. Its modern-day version in North America consists of communities such as Bountiful, British Columbia, where job and education opportunities for women are very limited.   

&gt;Far from polygamy being beneficial to women, it usually is anathema to women's economic, social and emotional well-being.

"&gt;Promotion of family"" cannot be a rational basis since the state government already endorses domestic partnerships and therefore impliedly believes that there is some sort of ""family benefit"" that exists in same-sex couplings.

That part of the argument was always the most illogical from so-called marriage protectors.  They [love to complain](http://www.protectmarriageoregon.com/why-marriage-matters/) about how many children are being born out of wedlock and their prescription to fix the issue is to RESTRICT consenting adults who might possibly like to have children in wedlock. 

A few other good tid bits from the ruling:

&gt;""One lesson to borrow from these and similar precedents is that laws regulating marriage must advance legitimate state interests, and not a mere desire to harm a particular class of its citizens""

And this one:

&gt;**The state's marriage laws discriminate based on sexual orientation, not gender.** In fact, the ban does not treat genders differently at all. Men and women are prohibited from doing the 
exact same thing: marrying an individual of the same gender. The ban does not impact males and 
females differently. Instead, the state's marriage laws classify same-gender couples differently 
than opposite-gender couples. While opposite-gender couples may marry a partner of their choice, same-gender couples may not. 

One more:

&gt;The marriage laws place the plaintiffs and other gay and lesbian 
couples seeking to marry in Oregon at a disadvantage, and the laws do so without any rationally related government purpose.

This is akin to saying ""the ban does not impact blacks and whites differently"" in regards to laws prohibiting interracial marriage prior to Loving v. Virginia. I can't believe he actually said that in the ruling.

Blacks and whites were prohibited from doing the exact same thing: marrying an individual of a different race. Blacks and whites weren't treated differently under the interracial marriage ban, just as men and women aren't treated differently under the same-sex marriage ban. Obviously that's not discriminatory at all since both groups were disenfranchised equally! 

Just as it's racial discrimination to say whites can only marry whites and blacks can only marry blacks, I'll always stand by the idea that it's gender discrimination to say men can only marry women and women can only marry men.

Ultimately, sexual orientation is entirely dependent on gender, so claiming the law discriminated on sexual orientation and *not* gender is utter bullshit. It discriminated based on both. Since a lesbian woman could legally marry a gay man, sexual orientation was clearly not the only factor.

In Oklahoma, [75%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Question_711) of voters voted in favor of the ban on same-sex marriage, yet it was recently declared unconstitutional. 

The Supreme Court's decision last year basically voided all of the state-specific constitutional bans on same-sex marriage, whether the state is ultra-conservative or liberal.

However, these issues are complicated, I think it's important to note that the states you cited have the issue very tangled up in court. I think the states that harbor a strong gay culture and progressive ideal struggle much less with this issue. My home state, Montana, hasn't even had a challenge to the ban yet. We're talking about 19 states out of 50 with gay marriage. We're talking about either a single strong minded judge whose decision will be challenged, or states with a strong progressive attitude that made it happen, or some combination of the two. My point is that without these strong cultures or causes, this issue struggles more to find its way to court. I totally understand your point, but I certainly think its ridiculous to deny that a culture of equality in a place like Oregon did not aid, in some way, to the decision of the judge, and the placement of the issue in the agenda.

"That isn't really an answer to my question.  But since you brought it up, I'll address it.  

&gt; I just think in the grand scheme of things, voters rights rights should be upheld 

I think so too.  But this isn't a case about voter's rights.  It's about equal protection under the law.  The US Constitution, through the 14th Amendment, guarantees us all that neither the federal government nor the states can discriminate against us based on our membership in a particular class.  This is why the SCOTUS overturned anti-miscegenation laws (laws banning marriage between blacks and whites) in 1967, despite those laws being very popular.  See [Loving v Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia).  Surely you wouldn't suggest that we should prevent interracial couples from getting married simply because the majority of the population wanted such a law?  This is why we guarantee equal protection under the law - it's easy for the majority to pass laws that discriminate against minority groups.  But that doesn't make it right or worthy of legal protection.  

&gt; Like it or not, it sets a bad president (sp?) To cherrypick voter approved referendums to overturn.

No, it sets a bad precedent to enshrine discrimination into law.  ",ThisDerpForSale,2014-05-21 09:33:50

 [**Alis volat propriis**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alis%20volat%20propriis): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;**Alis volat propriis** is a [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) phrase used as the [motto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_mottos) of [U.S. state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state) of [Oregon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon).

&gt;The official English version of the motto is ""She Flies With Her Own Wings,"" in keeping with the tradition of considering countries and territories to be feminine. However, because there is no feminine pronoun in the Latin words and the verb form is not inflected for gender, the phrase could be translated with equal validity as ""One flies with one's own wings"" or ""It flies with its own wings.""

&gt;If [macrons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron) are used to indicate the long vowels (standard practice in Latin dictionaries and textbooks), then the phrase becomes Ālīs volat propriīs.

"Yeah, but sadly it is considerably more expensive, or the same cost for 1/2 the speed.  I am paying $54/month for 50d/11u from comcast (it'll go back up to $75 in a year), and the 20d/1u service from Stephouse is $75/month.

Granted, it is Comcast, but one of my arguments for a long time is that Comcast is both expensive AND slow, and horrible customer services.  They don't innovate.  Well, at least for me, the cost are coming down a bit (or the services is starting to get a bit faster), but when I can pay $100 a month for 1GB d, then it is truly a leap in quality.  I'll pay more if I can get a leap in speeds AND customer service.",Attatt,2014-02-19 13:52:55
"I hear you. For me, the difference between 20 and 50 would be irrelevant...either is plenty for what we do. So it would break down to things like ""huge crazy customer-hating monopoly that does very worrysome things with my data and slows down Netflix, etc"" versus ""local smaller company that supports the EFF and speaks out about net neutrailty, etc."" I haven't tried them yet though, so I don't know about customer service, or how reliable the connection is.",trackofalljades,2014-02-19 14:46:59
"Yeah, admittedly that would be my thought process as well.  When the price is the same, it is easier to support the local company even at reduced speeds.  But, for the way my family consumes internet speeds, it is harder to pay $20 more a month for less than 1/2 the speed.  

I suppose, until then, I can't really bitch about it if I am not willing to vote with my wallet.",Attatt,2014-02-19 14:57:46

We were supposed to get 25Mbps VDSL and didn't find out until later that the phone lines in our older apartment complex could only handle the 6Mbps DSL, and since it was after we'd moved, we just learned to adapt for now.

 [**Cargo cult**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo%20cult): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A **cargo cult** is a kind of [Melanesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesia) [millenarian movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennarianism_in_colonial_societies) encompassing a diverse range of practices and occurring in the wake of contact with the commercial networks of colonizing societies. The name derives from the apparent belief that various ritualistic acts will lead to a bestowing of material wealth (""cargo"").  

&gt;Cargo cults often develop during a combination of crises. Under conditions of social stress, such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure. This leader may have a ""[vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_(spirituality\))"" (or ""myth-dream"") of the future, often linked to an ancestral efficacy thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality.   This leader may characterize the present state (often imposed by colonial capitalist regimes) as a dismantling of the old social order, meaning that social hierarchy and ego boundaries have been broken down. 

&gt;Contact with colonizing groups brought about a considerable transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies. Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the trade networks involved in resource distribution and an attempt to acquire such goods in the wake of interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new social relationships, with material relations being secondary. 

&gt;Since the late twentieth century, alternative theories have arisen. For example, some scholars, such as Kaplan and Lindstrom, focus on Europeans' characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about Western [commodity fetishism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism).  Others point to the need to see each movement as reflecting a particularized historical context, even eschewing the term ""cargo cult"" for them unless there is an attempt to elicit an exchange relationship from Europeans.

&gt;

&gt;**Silicon Forest** is a nickname for the cluster of [high-tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_technology) companies located in the [Portland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) metropolitan area in the [U.S. state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state) of [Oregon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon), and most frequently refers to the industrial corridor between [Beaverton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaverton,_Oregon) and [Hillsboro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsboro,_Oregon) in northwest Oregon.

&gt;The name is analogous to [Silicon Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley). In the [greater Portland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Portland) area, these companies have traditionally specialized in hardware — specifically test-and-measurement equipment (Tektronix), computer chips (Intel and an array of smaller chip manufacturers), electronic displays (InFocus, Planar and [Pixelworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixelworks)) and printers (Hewlett-Packard Co., Xerox and Epson). There is a small [clean technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology) emphasis in the area.

I grew up wanting to be a police officer. I was the kid that had to wave at police nonstop in the backseat of the car and counted any return wave or nod from the officer as a victory.

Now I live in a city that openly acknowledges they have a pro arrest policy. The last time I checked, the numbers for 2012 were in and my city police had arrested enough people that year to account for one in every ten citizens versus the city of Portland who's numbers amounted to one in every 30 citizens.

I admire the Portland police record and I was sincere when I thanked the officer in the video for handling himself in an admirable way. I would love to see more examples like this, as I want to restore my faith in the police. 

I am all grown up, almost 50. Clearly my life experiences have been different than yours. Read this brief article.

Also, I'm neither a police lover, nor hater. I agree that the subject is very controversial. Different organizations establish their own cultures, good and bad. As dynamics of civilization rapidly evolve, balancing citizen rights with adequate law enforcement becomes complicated. Not all police forces maintain respect for citizen rights as they adapt.

Bike thieves in this town are rampant. And I can't afford a personal guard for my bike. I purchased the best U-lock I could afford and a cable for the front tire, and I use these; but I know one day I will walk out of some place and my bike will be gone.

A couple weeks ago I saw someone camped on the sidewalk near the Morrison bridge east offramp and they had several bicycles around them, a couple of them taken apart, and appeared to be taking one apart at the time. It was pretty visible though. You probably wouldn't be able to challenge the ownership of a wealthy looking person with a nice bicycle. Would you need special cause to ask this person with several bicycles whether he owns them?

"[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Deviant-Desires-Incredibly-Strange-Sex/dp/1890451037) has an excellent section on pony play (way before anyone even heard of furry or a Brony). I bought a copy circa 2000 and cracked it open when I was coming down from an acid trip. I discovered then, that my old boss from New York was way into pony play and there were pictures of her and her younger boyfriend doing the pony thing. I had always guessed she was up to some kinky shit but I had no idea. ",snugglebandit,2014-04-06 18:08:17

&gt;

&gt;**Whale oil** is [oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil) obtained from the [blubber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber) of [whales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale). Whale oil was sometimes known as **train oil**, which comes from the Dutch word traan (""tear"" or ""drop"").

&gt;[Sperm oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_oil) is a special kind of oil obtained from the head cavities of [sperm whales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale). It is chemically different from ordinary whale oil, being mostly liquid wax. It had different properties and applications than regular whale oil, and was more expensive.

&gt;Whale oil was widely used in oil lamps and to make soap and margarine. With the discovery of substitutes such as kerosene and vegetable oils, the use of whale oils declined considerably. With most countries having banned whaling, the sale and use of whale oil today is almost non-existent.

"Everyone would get used to the routine snow and it'd be nothing special. 

Portland makes a fuss over accumulated snow because it happens so rarely now. 

Any city that routinely gets the stuff doesn't even care when there's an accumulation-unless it is a significant increase over normal. 

Just look at how used to the rain most Oregonians are. 

We grew up with it-and many of us natives really don't bother with an umbrella (but did opt for bread bags over our socks in the hopes of keeping our feet dry when wearing worn out shoes to the bus stop-thanks mom) because we just don't care about the rain that much (or could find enough flannels at goodwill to layer up with, but never saw an umbrella there so never had the chance to buy one), but the flood of '96 is something that was fussed over, because it was a hell of a lot more water than normal.  

My wife grew up in upstate NY and thinks nothing of snow other than if it is enough to XC ski to work or not.

I'm cautiously optimistic. They're actually pretty good at running liquor stores.

Even if the implementation of 91 isn't perfect, it's a huge step forward; at the very least it's a major blow to the prison-industrial complex. We can always change the details down the line if the state weed stores turn out to be terrible, but I think the fact that we have continued to allow them to handle liquor distribution says a lot.

"Thanks, but you forgot 92, oh wait, you guys only care about 91.

Anyhow, a good example is Section 60 seems to be trying to make any local legislature on the matter more difficult, and seems to be pointless if a resident of the area recreationally can still use the substance so long as it is bought from a licensed vendor in the area, which selling the substance in the area seems to be unable to be prohibited. Essentially, it sounds like saying ""Oh we're a dry county, but you can drink in your home as long as you buy it from the bar, or the convenience store that sells beer and wine"", doesn't sound like it even has a point.

I'm happy it's treated like smoking when it comes to public spaces, but Section 56 and 57 seem a bit unneeded. I'm fine with 56 somewhat, but the wording seems shaky as ""probable cause"" can be shaky. Normal unaided vision from a public place and readily recognized, which seems like mostly solid wording, but only time and precedence will probably show the effects of that. At least it defines a public place, but the inclusion of hallways and lobbies in an apartment could be shaky, as it could be considered an aided view if one is on a second or higher story and able to see into a neighbor's yard, hell we can even add in that while I'm not aware of the living conditions in Portland apartments, most I've seen and been to elsewhere are of the type that the space is public if you are a resident, or are visiting a resident. If you are wandering about, or on the premises without good reason, it could be called tresspassing, but really I should read up on laws regarding public spaces in Portland and Oregon.

With 51.2 we're looking at possible crossover into 92, but it depends on what we qualify under those terms. 47.1 doesn't fully detail Intoxication, but I'd assume drunkenness and being high count.

Generally I'm nit picky with bills, and I could keep reading. Aside from a few rough patches the bill is better than I remembered, but I still see points it can be improved upon.

"I was already reading the text and helped you out with the link.

I have my own issues with 92 that do not involve its drafting. You're welcome to discuss 92's shortcomings in drafting if you like, but you'll not find me an attentive audience.

More to the topic, I dislike how much legislation has been used to claim power from common law. Rather than draft broad areas of safe harbor and trespass then allow the courts to interpret, the legislature attempts to nail down every detail. I understand that since 91 is heavily modifying existing law it would naturally lead to this kind of construction, but it still bothers me.",Mourningblade,2014-11-05 00:58:50

"psilocybin mushrooms would probably be another good one. there's essentially no risk of a lethal dose or of becoming dependent on it. enforcement is completely non-existent (that's totally anecdotal but when's the last time you've heard of a mushroom bust?). and it would put more pressure on the federal government to rethink their drug scheduling.

psilocybin is a schedule I, but it fails all three tenets of schedule I:

###The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.

&gt;People typically don't abuse hallucinogenics. Every trip is going to be somewhat of an ordeal. It's not like getting drunk or high, you're gonna want a few days or weeks or months or even years before you try it again.  


###The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

&gt;Of course this is a Catch-22. If the drug is schedule I it's going to cause a chilling effect on discussing it, researching and ultimately finding acceptable medical uses. That said, psilocybin is somewhat similar to MDMA and LSD where the introspective, ego-shaking effects are known to help people get through depression, stress, and crises of purpose. Heh, here's a [Johns Hopkins](http://hub.jhu.edu/2014/09/11/magic-mushrooms-smoking) article saying they found psilocybin could be helpful in getting tobacco smokers to quit.

###There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.

&gt;The fact that Johns Hopkins are using psilocybin in studies contradicts this one outright. Of course that wont stop politically biased parties from saying that *all* uses have *no accepted safety*.

"Blood tests.

http://www.canorml.org/healthfacts/drugtestguide/drugtestdetection.html

""Unlike urine tests, blood tests detect the active presence of THC in the bloodstream. In the case of smoked marijuana, THC peaks rapidly in the first few minutes after inhaling, often to levels above 100 ng/ml in blood plasma. It then declines quickly to single-digit levels within an hour. High THC levels are therefore a good indication that the subject has smoked marijuana recently. THC can remain at low but detectable levels of 1-2 ng/ml for 8 hours or more without any measurable signs of impairment in one-time users. In chronic users, detectable amounts of blood THC can persist for days. In one study of chronic users, residual THC was detected for 24 to 48 hours or longer at levels of 0.5 - 3.2 ng/ml in whole blood (1.0 - 6.4 ng/ml in serum) ""

Edit: Oh from the actual bill text:
(4) On or before January 1, 2017, the commission shall:

(a)Examine available research, and may conduct or commission new research, to investigate the influence of marijuana on the ability of a person to drive a vehicle and on the concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol in a person's blood, in each case taking into account all relevant factors; and
(b) Present the results of the research to the Legislative Assembly and make recommendations to the Legislative Assembly regarding whether any amendments to the Oregon Vehicle Code are appropriate.",sumthingcool,2014-11-04 23:15:53

"Couple of reasons.

Because you will not even eat an oyster, yet you kill hundreds of ""animals"" with a nerve system more complex than an oyster when you walk across a lawn.

Because your actually hurting the causes you support: You cannot have a sustainable food economy without sustainable farming, and you cannot have sustainable farming without animals being part of the process.  You can't raise animals without killing the boys and eating them.  By removing yourself from nature, and not supporting local sustainable farms by purchasing their ethically raised meat you make it more expensive, and keep people buying factory meat.  Which is the thing you should be against.",Backhand_Bob,2013-04-19 14:10:14
"I see you're one of those people who thinks that since you can never be ""100%"" vegan, you shouldn't even bother. That is the number one misconception I deal with. I'll enlighten you. Our philosophy is not to save every life form on the earth. It is to reduce suffering as much as possible within reasonable means. If I accidentally kill a few bugs walking across a lawn, that doesn't make me any less vegan. The idea is to avoid killing animals as much as we can. 

Now to address your farming argument. I have no idea where you got this idea that meat is essential to the farming industry. Are you aware of how many resources farm animals consume? Even ""ethical"" farms, it's becoming less and less a practical means to sustainable food. Scientists suspect that everyone will HAVE to become vegetarian in the next 50 years because of the resources farm animals consume. Here's a link http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/vegetarian-2050-190426669.html 

While many will certainly agree that local farms are ""better"" to an extent than factory farms I want to make it clear that neither are ethical. Killing a sentient being for food when you can get the same nutrients elsewhere is wasteful and cruel. Perhaps there was a point in human history when we needed meat to survive, but we have since evolved past that need. We can be healthy, if not healthier without meat. So why kill? The answer most likely is out of convenience and habit. Humans have always eaten meat so why stop now? Well humans have always murder each other, we shouldn't make an effort to try and stop that either? I understand the difficulty around understanding and agreeing with veganism since we are taught since birth that meat is good, we need meat for protein etc. but now some of us have broken from this stigma. We are met with ridicule and hatred because people don't like being told that what they are doing is immoral and it makes them angry. So I guess I could understand to an extent why you dislike me, but to say that I am stupid for being a vegan is beyond ridiculous. ",Vonka,2013-04-19 15:25:25

By extension, a rejection of the food as morally wrong is interpreted as a judgement on the eater as morally wrong and complicit, which makes people instantly defensive.

I should add a comment though. You use the description 'portland hipster' as what appears to be a pejorative. My understanding is that a 'hipster', when used in this manner, refers to a stereotype of a 20-something under-employed, style-over-substance type of person that has become the Portland stereotype. I'm certain that I wouldn't associate those traits with folks running a small business that goes out of it's way to function with a light touch on the environment, as both the vegan ingredients and bicycle delivery bears witness to.

The Vegan Society was founded by Donald Watson, the man who initially coined the term so I think it would be reasonable to consider that definition pretty official. You will note that it doesn't say anything about eating or avoiding any specific foods.

Ethical veganism is about trying to reduce harm, exploitation and cruelty. Unless your friend is raping guys and swallowing their cum, it probably doesn't qualify as ""exploitation"" and there is no hypocrisy going on.",Vulpyne,2013-04-18 10:20:24

"&gt; Good for them, except that's not the official definition.

It doesn't seem very reasonable to go by MW's definition over the definition given to the word *by* the man that actually coined it, especially to the point of not even recognizing the validity of other definitions.

&gt; Sorry dude, she's a hypocrite.

So you like parsing definitions? Alright, let's see how that goes:

*hypocrisy: 1: a pretense of having a virtuous character, moral or religious beliefs or principles, etc., that one does not really possess.* — http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypocrisy?s=t

*hypocrisy: 1: a feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not; especially : the false assumption of an appearance of virtue or religion* — http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypocrisy

*Hypocrisy is the state of pretending to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that one does not actually have. Hypocrisy involves the deception of others and is thus a kind of lie.* ***Hypocrisy is not simply failing to practice those virtues that one preaches.*** — http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy

If you want to go by those definitions, you might say that she's misusing the word ""vegan"". However, that is not hypocrisy.

*animal: 2 a : one of the lower animals* ***as distinguished from human beings*** — http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/animal

*animal: 2. any such living thing* ***other than a human being.*** — http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/animal?s=t

So ""animal"" in that context may very well be excluding human beings, making a blowjob perfectly vegan.

*product: 2 a (1) : something produced; especially : commodity 1 (2) : something (as a service) that is marketed or sold as a commodity* — http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/product

Does it chastise you for the previous eating of other cookies?  These cookies *are sold at a shop with a high volume of dairy sales*.

"Not wrong.  Right and wrong don't particularly enter this arena in my mind... it's a matter of what is tasteful.  There is definitely a line (albeit fine) where something goes from humble to pretentious.  To evangelize one's own benevolence in accomplishing a cause also has it's philosophical merits (one might ask oneself is a bike delivered vegan *cookie* really doing the world a favor?  It still seems incredibly anthropocentric and banal to me, in the grand scheme of things).

Let me try to give an example of good vs bad example of this: Our operation is carbon-negative -- our operation saves whales.  Both are good things, but one is quantifiable, one is merely qualitative.  Both illicit the same gooey feeling in supporting the cause, but only one of these things do we know to have already had a profound effect (or, better yet, had little-to-no detrimental effect in our self-importance and self-indulgence).  

Bike-delivered errs in the latter column, in my opinion.  If you have a [literal] ton of cookies to deliver in the rain all over town, bike-delivery sounds like a terrible fucking idea.  A bio-diesel or electric powered vehicle makes much more business sense here.  Then you can spend the rest of your day saving whales, or whatever.  We have to know that the bike-delivery is intrinsically a good thing.

If they were successful at it, they could even buy land surrounding their farm using those IOUs, and grow *even more food* to sell, then they'd have to convince people to come work in their fields because it's gotten too big for the family to work themselves, so they'd trade some of the IOUs they've gotten from selling food to those workers who could then trade them for food from the farm or any other location.

Is there a point there? Murder is against the law yet people still do that.

&gt;When a cyclist runs a red light, they are really only putting themselves in danger. There is danger for the cars around them, but not like if they were in a car.

If a biker cuts me off or runs a red light, do you expect me to swerve and avoid said biker or just keep plowing forward because my vehicle will win that battle? I will try and avoid that biker every time which could mean me swerving into another car lane and harming others.

&gt;The majority of cyclist operate their bikes safely.

Do you have stats to back that up? I would guess the average biker taught themselves how to ride when they were kids and only the minority take the time to read learn about the official rules of the road. But I don't have stats to back that up so thats pure speculation on my part.

Anyhow, if traffic stops for me, I take the opportunity but I never expect a car to stop, and I don't get butthurt if they fly through the intersection without bending over backwards to accomodate me. I'll gladly wait for a gap.

While we're on the topic of MLK / Going, what I really hate is when I'm riding through the cut in the center island that's intended for my direction of travel, and some jackass decides he's going to race me by cutting over to the crosswalk cut, or the cut intended for oncoming bike traffic. They've usually just run a stop sign to ""make it"" in time when traffic is stopped-- blasting out into the intersection with barely a glance to make sure that all 4 lanes have stopped.

When we all reach the other side of the street, everyone gets pinched together as there's now 2 or 3 bikes angling for the same lane and trying to avoid oncoming car &amp; bike traffic and parked cars.

if you rear-ended someone the only two possibilities are that you weren't paying attention or followed too close for the conditions. People forget that you're supposed to leave enough room to break at the speed you're traveling and you have to add distance for any conditions like snow, rain, etc.

How could I prove a hypothetical? Besides people get charged or falsely cited all the time, but the the situation shouldn't work that way. It's black and white that you should allow proper stopping distance. People love to come up with reasons why ""it's not their fault"" but unless you see reverse lights coming at you or they're rolling down a hill back at you or something, it's your fault for rear-ending a car.

But, but, what if they're a scammer?!?! You know how scam artists work, right? They find a victim that is easy.

"This is not a hypothetical, rear end accidents are not always cut and dried follow too close cases. Keep reading, link provided.

We're not talking about scam, or tailgating. I know as well as anyone else that one must allow proper following distance.

The fact that you assume no one but you knows the traffic laws speaks volumes. I know the traffic laws, you on the other hand are totally dismissing the very specific case I brought forth. 

And you still did not find any source that proves I'm wrong. Why? Because I'm not wrong. And you seem to be arguing a point which I did not make.

Meanwhile, I'm proving you wrong. There's [this June 2010 rear end accident](http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/survivor-of-highway-accident-lays-no-blame-1.527300) in Montreal where a driver stopped on a freeway to help ducks. Two motorcyclists rear ended her **illegally** stopped car. Articles say she was arrested and released. Can't find the outcome but I've put in a request at /r/montreal

Follow too closely is rendered meaningless when a car is stopped on a freeway or other normally free flowing road. Okay, so now you're going to argue knowing your stopping distance. Great, except you have to be able to see. What may have happened in the Montreal case is a truck was obscuring the view of the motorcyclists who were abiding by the law and had a 2 or 3 second cushion. The truck changed lanes at the last second, the bikes were also boxed in and had no way out and no time to stop even though just a fraction of a second before they were well within the 2 second rule.

I'm not saying the Montreal bikers were completely without fault. I am saying the reckless stopped driver shares some perhaps even majority of the blame. Look, in law there's a concept of comparative negligence. I'm sorry if law does not fit into your common sense worldview but that's how it is.",encephlavator,2013-07-12 05:23:29
"&gt;This is not a hypothetical, rear end accidents are not always cut and dried follow too close cases. Keep reading, link provided.

&gt;The fact that you assume everyone but you knows the traffic laws speaks volumes. I know the traffic laws, you on the other hand are totally dismissing the very specific case I brought forth. 

I guess that's a matter of opinion because I am very well aware of who will be at fault in a typical rear-end collision where you seem to want to draw scenarios where someone wouldn't be at blame, but you were still wrong and couldn't prove you were right. So, really, a pissing contest over who knows the laws seems silly for you to get into. And a hypothetical case is a not a ""specific"" case, it's a very vague one.

I'm really sorry, I had to take a couple minutes to stop laughing. **You're trying to prove your damn point and the best you can come up with is a case in another country?!?!** Give me a break.

By the way, check out this part of your article:

""McKinnis said police are investigating to determine if the motorcyclists were simply unable to swerve past the parked car on the right, or if they were travelling too close and unable to stop in time.""

Again, how would the accident happen if you allowed enough stopping distance? It doesn't matter if it's foggy (shouldn't be over driving your headlights), or you can't see because a car is blocking your view ahead (this actually makes *less* sense because their motorcycles were probably following the *truck* too close, let alone the other car stalled in the lane).

Anybody at any time might slam on their brakes. Perhaps they are overreacting and being an idiot, or perhaps an animal or child ran in front of their car that you can't see.

Before you downvote me, and violate redditquette, I challenge you to find a source that proves read ends are **always** the rear ender's fault even in cases of road rage/reckless driving on the part of the rear endee.

Think about it. You cannot just slam on your brakes on the freeway at freeway speed just because--- whatever anger management problem you have. It would be foolhardy and I'm betting you would get cited if you told the attending cop you slammed on your brakes on purpose because you thought the person behind you was tailgating.",encephlavator,2013-07-12 02:59:02
"It doesn't always have to be 100% the fault of one driver or the other. If you slam on your brakes for no reason on a freeway and are rear-ended, a jury is likely to find you at fault.

Counterintuitively, driving slow and consistently and allowing empty space to collect in front of you will improve traffic flow for others. If your average speed is going to be 20 MPH with bursts between 40 and 0, you should just drive 20. If everyone did this, the line of traffic would accelerate in sync like a train accelerates, slowly but never giving up inertia.

This.

It's an excuse for driving too close to the car ahead of you, which is dangerous. Sure, if you get cut off it might take a few seconds of letting your foot off the gas to return to proper following distance, but it's the right thing to do, both for safety and for reducing traffic problems.

"And two seconds is the bare minimum in dry conditions. It's a minimum of 3 in wet conditions. You also need to add an additional second for highway speeds due to your kinetic energy not being linear.

Also, if someone is following to close, increase *your* following distance. This will allow you to slow down slower to give the person behind you more time.",IAmRoot,2013-07-11 17:41:11
"&gt; If you rear end somebody you were following too closely. It was your fault because you were driving like an impatient asshole

This is simply not true. One can not simply slam on their brakes for no good reason. Driving does not work that way. Driving relies on a lot of trust and predictable actions. No one expects the person in front to slam on the brakes for no reason, and I'm going to assert that such an action itself is reckless driving.

Think about this: A driver on the freeway slams on the brakes because he thinks the big SUV behind him is tailgating, the SUV swerves and misses, the next car is a Prius which was obeying the 2 second rule behind that SUV but they're boxed in and can't swerve and now the 2 second rule is meaningless because there's a car stopped in the middle of the road and **BAM**, rear end accident. 

I challenge you to find a cop who would say yeah, I'm citing the Prius driver, especially if the first driver confesses to purposely stopping on the freeway.

There was a huge thread a year or two ago about a driver in Canada (Toronto area?) who stopped on a freeway to save a duck or goose and a wreck ensued and I think someone was killed (a child?). Many many people took the stand that the person who stopped, though well intentioned, was at fault.

This point has already been made in this thread more than once, but here's the problem with deferring right-of-way:

I've faced this situation nearly every day for years so I am more than qualified to comment. My bike ride takes me across a busy 4 lane road. A driver will stop and wave me across, but I can't safely go because I see other cars coming at 30 to 35 from the right. I see other cars coming from the left and they aren't going to stop either because...

1. they don't have to stop

2. have no idea the stopped car waved me across

3. they most likely assume the stopped car is making a turn without a signal which distracts/confuses them ever so momentarily/slightly..

4. the stopped car, especially if large, blocks my view and the view of other drivers of me

and it makes crossing even more difficult and dangerous for me.

"I'm always so excited when I come across a roundabout. They're so efficient and fun (miss your turn? oh well just circle back around!), and y'know safer and reduces traffic and stuff. Also technically they're more environmentally friendly than traditional four way stops in that not only do you eliminate vehicles idling waiting for a light to change which is just a waste of gas, but you can put plants in the middle to make it pretty and reduce CO2!

(Seriously, they're pretty with all the plants and flowers in the middle--when was the last time you saw a roundabout that was an eyesore?)

I really wish we had many more of them. Maybe not downtown, but there are so many regular four-way stops in the suburbs that could just be replaced by a roundabout.

§ 811.028¹
Failure to stop and remain stopped for pedestrian

    • penalty

(1) The driver of a vehicle commits the offense of failure to stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian if the driver does not stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian when the pedestrian is:

(a) Proceeding in accordance with a traffic control device as provided under ORS 814.010 (Appropriate responses to traffic control devices) or crossing the roadway in a crosswalk; and

(b) In any of the following locations:

(A) In the lane in which the drivers vehicle is traveling;

(B) In a lane adjacent to the lane in which the drivers vehicle is traveling;

(C) In the lane into which the drivers vehicle is turning;

(D) In a lane adjacent to the lane into which the drivers vehicle is turning, if the driver is making a turn at an intersection that does not have a traffic control device under which a pedestrian may proceed as provided under ORS 814.010 (Appropriate responses to traffic control devices); or

(E) Less than six feet from the lane into which the drivers vehicle is turning, if the driver is making a turn at an intersection that has a traffic control device under which a pedestrian may proceed as provided under ORS 814.010 (Appropriate responses to traffic control devices).

(2) For the purpose of this section, a bicycle lane or the part of a roadway where a vehicle stops, stands or parks that is adjacent to a lane of travel is considered to be part of that adjacent lane of travel.

(3) This section does not require a driver to stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian under any of the following circumstances:

(a) Upon a roadway with a safety island, if the driver is proceeding along the half of the roadway on the far side of the safety island from the pedestrian; or

(b) Where a pedestrian tunnel or overhead crossing has been provided at or near a crosswalk.

(4) For the purposes of this section, a pedestrian is crossing the roadway in a crosswalk when any part or extension of the pedestrian, including but not limited to any part of the pedestrians body, wheelchair, cane, crutch or bicycle, moves onto the roadway in a crosswalk with the intent to proceed.

(5) The offense described in this section, failure to stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian, is a Class B traffic violation. [2005 c.746 §2; 2011 c.507 §1]

"&gt;t's the pedestrians who stand at the side of the road and wait for traffic to clear.

I am almost 100% positive that drivers are supposed to stop at crosswalks for pedestrians *signaling* they intend to cross. I believe the written driving test said that ""signaling"" they wanted to cross was having one foot in the crosswalk. I tend to just look if the person is looking at oncoming traffic, is facing perpendicular to the street, and is at least near the edge of the sidewalk.

Otherwise cars would have to stop for every idiot standing near a crosswalk talking to someone or something. You have to make a reasonable effort to make it clear you want to cross.

Which brings up a good point about road laws--be assertive. Make it clear to every person around you what you're intending to do, whether it's acting like you want to cross the street or change lanes in heavy traffic. The less that other road users have to infer about your intentions, the better. That goes for everyone.",ricodued,2013-07-12 01:39:08

"I don't think there is a winning solution, here. If the pedestrian starts walking, they don't know the car is going to stop. On Powell, for example, people blow by the crosswalks all the time because it is often hard to see the pedestrian in enough time to stop on such a busy road with poorly marked crosswalks. As a pedestrian, I don't feel comfortable stepping out on the hope that I'm going to be seen. Sometimes I feel like a dick when I wait for the cars to slow down pretty significantly (I have a hard time judging speed watching a car approach me) before walking, but I'd rather annoy a few motorists than get myself killed.

If you don't signal your intent to cross, motorists don't have to stop for you unless you're already in the crosswalk.

Slamming on your brakes for someone who hasn't ""signaled"" their intent to cross by putting their foot or whatever in the road is unnecessary and is likely to cause accidents.

This isn't a reason to just blow past anyone who hasn't clearly signaled--be courteous, of course, and if you can tell the person wants to cross but hasn't properly signaled, you can go ahead and **stop if it is safe to do so**, but don't slam on your brakes for every person that happens to be standing near a street corner.",ricodued,2013-07-12 01:56:04

"Yes, pedestrians also need to be aware of how their actions affect traffic.  

People who approach a crosswalk, stand there and zone out oblivious to the fact that traffic is waiting for them are annoying.  

People who hang out right at the end of the crosswalk with no intention of crossing are annoying.  

People who want to cross, but stand 4 feet back from the curb, often with no body language signalling intent to cross, are annoying and are likely going to be there a while.  When they get irritated about it, they are vaguely amusing.  

Want to cross? Stand right at the edge of the curb, look at the traffic, and even better mime stepping off the curb into traffic and you'll have good results at stopping traffic and drivers will appreciate the clearly signaled intent.

"Not to mention it seems that the last thing the officers want to do is arrest them.

There was a woman a couple weeks back who would just sit down in the road right in front if where the buses pullout. She did this for 3 different buses, each time someone physically had to move her out of the road. 

PPB shows up and she kicks it  up to maximum homeless power  level 9001. She just stood by crosswalk, hitting the button and immediately attempting to jump in front of cars. The officers pulled her aside and handcuffed her, but in the end they just spoke with her for a bit and left. I think they know these people want to be arrested and therefore don't.

I really wish there was a better support system for the ones with mental disabilities... There is a crew of 5-10 homeless that live, basically, on my doorster. After speaking with them it is pretty obvious that the majority have mental health issues.

Yes. Rehab. CCC operates a free treatment clinic, named Hooper Detox, I believe.

They need a place to live, get long term mental help, get job training, etc. They may be in such a condition that they will *never* be able to live an independent life. Does that mean they should be tossed out on the street?

The homeless in this city, and some of the homed, need more care than our current system wants to provide even though ""we"" as a country pay in many other ways instead.

With that said, even with the world's greatest mental health care system, it wouldn't mean that guy on that patch of grass would even get helped.

In order to receive treatment you need to accept treatment. And the very far majority of the severely mentally ill reject medical help. You have to understand this: they are not thinking clearly and won't come to this logical sane and rational decisions they should be treated.

It's not like someone who's been stabbed realizes they're bleeding and they should see a doctor.

There's a very high bar to be set in order for forced treatment to occur. It wasn't always like this, you could have someone committed pretty easy ""back in the good old days.""

"According to this article: http://www.care2.com/causes/this-is-what-happens-when-a-city-gives-the-homeless-a-home.html#ixzz3QzjsYpcy

&gt; It cost Salt Lake City approximately $20,000 annually to deal with the myriad issues associated with each homeless person on the street. By giving them a home, it costs them $10,000-12,000 per person, per year. By focusing on chronic homelessness, it would free up resources for everyone, including emergency shelters and services for those in need of temporary help.

&gt; The Housing First program takes a different approach than most housing programs. It does not require employment or participation in a drug treatment program. Once in a home, they work with a case worker to access other services, including counseling and job services. While the housing is labeled as permanent supportive housing, nearly 50 percent of the participants exit within two years to a permanent, self sustaining situation. The program began in Salt Lake City and has been expanded across the state.

So by giving the homeless a home, SLC saves approximately $8-10k per person per year, or about 40-50%.

&gt; When Salt Lake and San Francisco began their 10-year plans to end chronic homelessness in 2005 and 2004, respectively, each had about 3,000 people who lived full time on their streets. Today, San Francisco has about 2,000 - and Salt Lake has about 400.",jeckles,2015-02-06 11:33:33

However, this is clearly not the case due to the fact that they've decreased their homeless population by such a huge margin.

"&gt; By giving them a home, it costs them $10,000-12,000 per person, per year. 

10k to 12k ain't happening per person in Portland and ain't happening  in SF.

This was also in the article, and it's very important:

&gt; By contrast, most of Salt Lake's approximately 1,000 supportive housing units are in complexes **away from the city core,**

It's cost prohibitive to house people in expensive parts of town, but advocates locally won't admit that.

Housing first sounds great, but it sounds better when you're not an actual mecca for homeless and don't burden a single city or concentrate the problem in part of town -- or have actual open-air drug markets.

Anyways, 1,000 units of ""supportive housing""? Big whoop, we do a lot more here than they have. We're doing so much more for homeless than SLC.

---

&gt;__Care Not Cash__ was a [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) ballot measure (Proposition N) approved by the voters in November 2002. Primarily sponsored by [Gavin Newsom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom), then a San Francisco supervisor, it was designed to cut the money given in the [General Assistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assistance) programs to homeless people in exchange for shelters and other forms of services. The major intent of this measure was to prevent the cash grants given to be used for purchasing drugs and alcohol, and to strongly encourage homeless people to enter shelters or housing and obtain counseling and other services.

Also, this guy had a sign saying he sells heroin to the world. I think it's fair to say culture wise he's as far away from gainful employment as he can be, and that's  on him, nobody forced him to do that.

---

&gt;Often the poorhouse was situated on the grounds of a poor farm on which able-bodied residents were required to work; such farms were common in the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A poorhouse could even be part of the same economic complex as a [prison farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_farm) and other penal or charitable public institutions. Poor farms were [county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_the_United_States)- or town-run residences where paupers (mainly elderly and disabled people) were supported at public expense. The farms declined in use after the [Social Security Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act) took effect in 1935, with most disappearing completely by about 1950.

&gt;The __world's most liveable cities__ is an informal name given to any [list of cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities) as they rank on an annual survey of [living conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living). Countries that have cities commonly ranked within the top ten, almost always include [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) and [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada). Three examples of the surveys are [Monocle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocle_(lifestyle_magazine\))'s ""Most Liveable Cities Index"", the [Economist Intelligence Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist_Intelligence_Unit)'s ""Liveability Ranking and Overview"", and ""[Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_(consulting_firm\)) Quality of Living Survey"". Liveability rankings are designed for use by employers assigning hardship allowances as part of job relocation. There have been numerous arguments over the expansion of liveability rankings for other purposes. However, the annual city rankings attract extensive media coverage, and are a popular topic of discussion. However, the rankings are not used for economic forecasting or government policy.   The OECD Better Life Index however, factors in socio-economic comparisons of the livability of cities across the world.

&gt; If you're sitting around frowning at your tax rates, worry about the war machine..

This is not the argument I am making. I am making the argument of results we get on the streets every.fucking.day.

We are failing at addressing homelessness and it's not from a lack of resources necessarily.

Edit: You've essentially just turned on all blinders and are assuming things I am saying or things I am meaning to say or things I am representing. Does my comment mean that people on welfare buy drugs or welfare is bad? No, it means that the uncontrolled nature of it in conjunction with an out-of-control drug scene like Vancouver has caused some major problems (to the point that restricting what people buy with their money) might be something they should pursue.

"&gt; Probably, but actual customer interest is still pretty high up on the chain.

I'm not saying it isn't.  Of course actual customer interest matters.  But that one link isn't how Google is figuring it out.  That link is a way for them to get interested people on an email mailing list.  I signed up for it.  At this point, we're past the point where Google is figuring out customer interest here.  They're more likely figuring out logistics and how to get the most perks from the city.

&gt; And to be honest, barring the count of current broadband users, I'm unsure of what analytic they'd even use outside of ""I WANT IT"" surveys.

They probably don't even have to judge consumer interest at this point. Cheaper reliable broadband sells itself.  And since so many people hate their broadband provider, Google doesn't have a hard sell to do.  For them, it's more a matter of getting enough perks from a city to make it worth their while to come here before going somewhere else first - and I hope they do!

&gt; Why would they bother basing their neighborhood decisions on some obscure web form? Surely they will be looking at logistical and demographic information to make such decisions.

That, along with figuring out if they can get more financial incentives here than somewhere else is what will determine whether or not we get Google Fiber sooner rather than later.

What sucked was this was around my peak of WoW playing, and I would have been the main tank for my guild if I didn't have the random disconnecting problems.

I had 3 techs visit who couldn't find anything wrong before I marched to the ComCast customer service center in Tigard and raised hell.  They sent a supervisor tech who found the problem, expressed frustration that the other techs didn't find it, and fixed it.

A month later, the problem came back, I called up, they sent a tech, couldn't find anything wrong.  I was PISSED at this point, but I said ""Fuck it"" because I was moving in a month.

When I moved into a new apartment, I got Verizon DSL.  It was only 1 mbps (versus ComCast's 6 mbps at the time), but I didn't care.  It was fast enough to stream YouTube (They didn't have HD yet back then) and play games, so that's all I cared about.

"To follow up on rssenior's (community member with input to the Broadband Strategic Plan - and beyond) OLive comment, I think it worth mentioning that it is notable that we are really hungry for Google fiber because it would mean there is any competition at all.
Looking slightly beyond that, there was a time when there was a possibility of a more free market landscape when any number of entrants could have been ISPs (buy upstream, have modems or access to open DSL). This has not changed, but the bandwidth requirements for ""average"" bandwidth usage have outpaced those mediums, and require deploying a new medium that can reach consumers at an adequate speed.
Truly leveraging the market would require deployment of a medium that could be open to any new entrant (as with the services that ride on the top of the internet). This is not the case with traditional ""wire"" that is deployed to the premises. That has been deployed by one company, for that company, and everyone else would need to incurr similar costs to do so (ie google). We have enjoyed Comcast's spoils at doing so, but an open medium could produce savings and tailored packages (business, speed, services, filtering?, web services, etc).
So, yes, competition is better than none, but perhaps we could hope for more in the future with a neutral medium.

Right now, a large number of people are paying the tax penalty for going w/o insurance because they can't afford it with their $25,000 salary, and there is a $2000 deductible anyway. When my 30 yr old coworker got shingles recently, another coworker explained that if you ask your doctor for the shingles vaccine you would be charged $600 for an optional treatment, but it would be lower if the doctor recommended it by themselves.

"&gt;  a substantial fraction of people coming down with measles ... did have the vaccine

That's why it's so important that everyone be vaccinated if they can - vaccines don't completely prevent infection, they just greatly reduce the likelihood.  The point is that if everyone is vaccinated, the rate of infection is lower than the rate at which hosts recover or die, until ultimately the virus disappears entirely.  This is called herd immunity, and by refusing to vaccinate their children, people aren't just risking their children's health, but literally everyone else's (even if those people were responsible and did get vaccinated).",fnordit,2015-02-07 14:38:24

&gt;When you are shown to be wrong,

The sad thing is that I haven't been shown to be wrong. Show me some studies that defend their methods with good statistics, i.e., show statistical power instead of pointing to a lack of arbitrary significance. You have to have enough power to see results if there are any to be seen. In other words you need a sufficient sample size and be looking in the right place, among other things. Thanks to things like publication bias, it is entirely possible for an entire scientific discipline to get things wrong. Science has to continuously prove itself. It doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. Try again.

&gt;the least you can do is pretend to be man enough to admit it instead of trying to double down on your BS and then storm off in a hissy fit of profanity when you realize that the grownups aren't going to debase themselves in order for you to save face.

The least you can do is Google statistical power and learn a little about science. Perhaps then you'd realize that by agreeing with me you're not debasing yourself. If you want to go above and beyond you might want to see about easing up on the ad hominem too. You can't use personal attacks as a premise to an argument and get rational people to buy it. Also, no, I am not a hypocrite. I don't use ad hominem myself even though it appears to idiots that I do. My foul language and personal attacks are me venting and/or conclusions, not premises or propositions. Dealing with idiots like you takes a lot of out a person.

"&gt;I don't get the distinction you're making... it's when you actually act in ways that harm others that your freedom gets limited

The distinction is this: is it acting in ways that *actually do* harm others or ways that *merely may* harm others? To me, there is a huge difference and your confusion reinforces the model that I have that most people are completely incapable of separating possibility from actuality. Don't even get me started on the distinction between possible and probable and the idiots and their confusion and conflation of those two. They equate the two completely ontologically different things (possible and actual) so thoroughly that it also just boggles my mind. To them possible is actual. The same goes for not differentiating between rage and indignation, then attributing all of the negative rage connotations with all anger, even indignation which is good. So, which is it, actual harm, or possible harm? You realize that there is absolutely no harm unless there is actual harm unless harm extends to your fragile wittle feewings, yes?

&gt;Your freedom is limited at risk because by definition it is a precursor to probable harm.

OMG, fucking probable. Really?!

&gt;Hence why we allow some type of risk and not others, because the risk is deemed to be outweighed by the benefit of allowing it.

Oh, God! So you do think that possible = probable = actual? If you don't, where do you get off thinking you get to weigh jack? You realize that if you actually hurt someone because they broke your hallowed rules but didn't actually harm anyone/anything except maybe your feewings, you're a fucking tyrant and wholly wrong and unethical, yes? Where do you get off actually harming someone when they didn't?

&gt;For reference see Negligent homicide. You don't have to want to hurt others for your actions to do so.

Duh! But it sure seems like it is a mitigating factor somehow. So much so that you can attempt to kill someone and fail and suffer a worse fate than someone that actually killed someone even though they didn't intend to. That just further boggles my mind.

"&gt;So you do think that possible = probable = actual?

No, but I do think that if something is probable then it is prudent to take precautions against it.

&gt;If you don't, where do you get off thinking you get to weigh jack?

Where do I ""get off""? I ""get off"" by understanding that we as human beings have the capacity to judge potential risks and benefits from certain courses of action and that as a society we all come together to decide what is best for our society. Given those two things we come together and create these things called ""laws"" that restrict personal freedom in some way in exchange for (hopefully) providing a better society. The members of said society agree on this in some fashion (majority rules, representative government, etc...) and such rules are enforced. For more details on ideas like this please look at a middle-school social studies course.

Unless you're an anarchist you probably also agree with this at some level, so likely we're just talking about where the line of ""potential risk"" should be drawn. Given that it would serve you much better to not attack me and my ""feewings"", which no one but you has brought up or given any weight whatsoever, and to instead focus on actually explaining your position. Because right now I'm not certain what it is, only that you're very angry about it.

&gt;you're a fucking tyrant and wholly wrong and unethical, yes? 

Your hyperbole aside, no, enforcing rules on society does not always mean you're a ""fucking tyrant"" or ""wholly wrong and unethical"". Sure, people can use and abuse society's rules to be those things, but they are not one and the same.

&gt;Anyway, that is a tangent. ... Care to expound?

"&gt;No, but I do think that if something is probable then it is prudent to take precautions against it.

Ethical precautions I would hope. Sadly, that thought probably never crossed your mind because of those feelings I started attacking.

&gt;I ""get off"" by understanding that we as human beings have the capacity to judge potential risks and benefits from certain courses of action

You try, and you fail badly. Either your incredibly ignorant or your feelings cloud your judgement. I am not sure which.

&gt;as a society we all come together to decide what is best for our society...

The problem here is that it isn't 'all'. If you think it is 'all' you are completely bat shit insane. If everyone had a say and only the things everyone agrees on happened, there wouldn't be a problem. The way things 'work' now is you have some subset of assholes trying to force their bullshit onto everyone. Obviously you're cool with coercion so that fact that nobody really has a choice about society - nobody chooses to be born and there hasn't been a frontier for over a century - never crosses your mind when it comes to ethics. To make it clear, there is no fucking social contract. Contracts aren't legit if there is coercion involved. That matters!

&gt;Unless you're an anarchist you probably also agree with this at some level, so likely we're just talking about where the line of ""potential risk"" should be drawn

I agree that some laws should be explicated and enforced. I don't agree on how they are made and I certainly don't agree with 'risk' whatsoever. The only laws that should exist are ones that define actual harm and mete out just punishment. No matter the risk, it is unethical to actually hurt someone as a punishment for something they didn't do but could have or may have or even will. It isn't just in any way, shape, or form. The *only* way I am aware of to conceive of it as just is to equate actuality and possibility. Are you fucking serious?!

&gt;Given that it would serve you much better to not attack me and my ""feewings""

Why not? How am I served no matter what happens? You're not going to change your mind no matter how civil I am.

&gt;Because right now I'm not certain what it is, only that you're very angry about it.

I am angry about people being unethical assholes. You're free to vaccinate. I am cool with a subset of the vaccinations. There is over a 90% vaccination rate. You have your fucking herd immunity pretty much, yet you want to violate the rights of others and force vaccinations on them? You do know there are risks either way, yes? You also know that by being coercive you are violating their rights, yes? Put yourself in their shoes you fucking psycho!

&gt;enforcing rules on society does not **always** mean you're a ""fucking tyrant"" or ""wholly wrong and unethical"". Sure, people can use and abuse society's rules to be those things, but they are not one and the same.

Rules that foster rights are the exception that I emphasized there. The overwhelming majority violate rights. Tyranny doesn't happen from good laws being abused. Any law that can be abused is complicit in tyranny and is bad. Thomas Jefferson said it very well with,

&gt;Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will. But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law,' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the right of an individual.

What if the anti-vaccine thing became so popular they wanted to make laws banning vaccines, robbing you of your right to vaccinate yourself or your kids? It is the same, damn, thing! I think you are blinded by your feelings. You want to feel safe and you feel that those evil antivaxxers are fucking with it. Until they get infected though they are innocent and blameless. Once infected, they are a fucking victim of whatever asshole infected them. Only once they infect others are they violating the equal rights of others, becoming assholes themselves.

You idiots are going about things all wrong. If you're going to make and enforce a law, do it ethically! Fuck! Punish folks after the fact. Instead of interfering with a person's right to choose, educate them on the new, ethical laws and the consequences thereof. Let them know that if they take that gamble and get infected, they will be tested so that hopefully the perpetrator can be found and, if they happen to infect others, they'll be punished. Nucleic acid tests can be pretty cool, given mutations and stuff. Quarantine them, give them prison time, or even execute them if they end up killing or maiming someone. All that stuff would be ethical and probably a better motivator for vaccines than your bullshit. Forcing stuff on the innocent is horribly fucked up. Why can't you see that? Just because your unethical ass votes it and you try to appeal to society this or risk that, that doesn't make it right. Democracy is a tyranny where the 51% violate the rights of the other 49%... and that is if you are lucky. The bullshit the USA has devolved to has an even lower threshold.

Finally, I would like to add that there is a power differential that influences ethics. The state has more resources than most people. It is therefore much worse ethically for the government to violate a persons rights than it is for a private citizen to violate that same persons rights. At least in the latter case there is more hope of the state seeing the truth and avenging the victim. Trying to fight city hall and get vengeance is a difficult proposition and only the flinty few succeed, often by unconventional means.",DrHappyFunTime,2015-02-08 10:50:18

"&gt; Ok. cue up the laws mandating that children be fed a specific quantity and type/mixture of food.

Are you seriously throwing this up as a rational argument?

&gt; what's the distinction in your eyes?


Common fucking sense maybe?

Lets look at the two situations:

Mandatory Vaccines:

* Inexpensive
* Relatively low inconvenience level-- You only need to get a few vaccinizations as children. In addition, since immunized children will on average be sick less, the actual inconvenience level will probably be a net positive.
* Provides lasting-- in many cases lifetime-- benefit 
* Provide herd immunity. The higher the number of people in a community that are vaccinated, the lower the odds of anyone, even the non-vaccinated people, of getting sick.
* Related to that, helps prevent the parents from getting sick since they will be less likely to bring illnesses into the home.
* Easy to implement and enforce.
* Very favorable cost/benefit and inconvenience/benefit ratios. 
* Very small ""actual"" invasion into personal liberties.

Mandatory Quantity/ and type/mixture feeding laws.

* Expensive.
* Extremely high inconvenience level. 
* Massive invasion into personal liberties-- possibly the single biggest invasion ever proposed since the abolition of slavery.
* Provides no benefit except to the person whose diet is being enforced. Edit: And even for them it is only a purely statistical benefit, and comes at an extremely high personal cost.
* Extremely difficult to implement, nearly impossible and very expensive to enforce.
* extremely negative cost/benefit and convenience/benefit ratios.

When you actually look at the realities involved, it seems to me that it is pretty fucking obvious that these are not analogous issues at all. Any rational person would see that it is a massive leap from imposing the first to imposing the second.

So do you really still think this is a reasonable response to a discussion about mandatory vaccinations, or is it just hysterical fear-mongering? Seems to me it is very much the latter.",SomeRandomMax,2015-02-07 20:59:34

"&gt;Childhood obesity comes with an estimated price tag of $19,000 per child when comparing lifetime medical costs to those of a normal weight child, according to an analysis led by researchers at the Duke Global Health Institute and Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore. When multiplied by the number of obese 10-year-olds in the United States, lifetime medical costs for this age alone reach roughly $14 billion.

Sounds pretty costly. 

Anyways, i'm not really into a technocracy where my life is driven and dictated by ""big data"", thank you. There's no need for chicken pox, hep b, flu vaccines, or food control for children in the way that vaccinations for polio and whooping cough are needed. 

There were never outbreaks and problematic, population-wide epidemics of hep. b (forget infection rates, and focus on actual complications) or chickenpox before their respective vaccines were developed.

There quite clearly were (and still are) issues with outbreaks of polio, measles, yellow fever, and so on and so forth, which is why global health authorities have tried very hard to eradicate those diseases (or control their spread). 

Contrast this to chickenpox which isn't even on a list of recommended (let alone required) vaccines in many other developed nations.

The chickenpox vaccine is weird.  When I first heard about it (and about it's becoming a standard part of a vaccination schedule) I thought it was unnecessary too.  But I've realized something since then.  Chickenpox is a disease we all grew up with, to the point of being a part of childhood culture like Sesame Street, and for most of us the disease left little impact (maybe a small scar or two).  However, as we all know, chickenpox becomes more dangerous with age.  With the advent of a vaccine, fewer and fewer kids are getting chickenpox, which means the ones who aren't vaccinated are much less likely to get exposed in childhood, leaving them vulnerable as adults.  Also, while most children just got itchy and a bit feverish, a non-insignificant number of children got very ill from the disease and some even died.  Chickenpox can also lead to shingles in adulthood, which is a much more serious disease.

On the one hand, I want to agree with you and put chickenpox in the same mental category as flu shots.  However, flu shots are also weird in that they're targeting a very specific form of a wide-ranging disease, and may or may not work depending on what boils down to chance (i.e. what strain of the virus ends up being prevalent that year), and one flu shot won't cover you for life.  Chickenpox, while not as serious as polio, measles, etc., is still a fairly uniform disease that's directly targeted by a vaccine, rather than a slew that need to be concocted and re-concocted every year based on predictions of what form ""the flu"" is going to take this upcoming year.  For most people, the flu makes them miserable and miss work for a few days/weeks every year or so, but there are still people who die from the flu.  I'm sure that if there was only one form of the flu out there and we had a vaccine for it (or a single vaccine that covered all forms of the flu) that would become mandatory as well.

tl;dr: Chickenpox makes some people very sick and even die.",Rukita,2015-02-07 13:28:12
"&gt; flu shots are also weird in that they're targeting a very specific form of a wide-ranging disease, and may or may not work depending on what boils down to chance (i.e. what strain of the virus ends up being prevalent that year)

This is part of the anti-science rhetoric that has gotten the country into this mess. It is not random chance at all.... Here is a short primer....

* How are the viruses selected to make flu vaccine?

&gt;The influenza (flu) viruses selected for inclusion in the seasonal flu vaccines are updated each year based on which influenza virus strains are circulating, how they are spreading, and how well current vaccine strains protect against newly identified strains. Currently, 141 national influenza centers in 111 countries conduct year-round surveillance for influenza and study influenza disease trends. These laboratories also send influenza viruses to the five World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza located in Atlanta, Georgia, USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC); London, United Kingdom (National Institute for Medical Research); Melbourne, Australia (Victoria Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory); Tokyo, Japan (National Institute for Infectious Diseases); and Beijing, China (National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention) for additional analyses.

&gt;The influenza viruses in the seasonal flu vaccine are selected each year based on surveillance-based forecasts about what viruses are most likely to cause illness in the coming season. WHO recommends specific vaccine viruses for inclusion in influenza vaccines, but then each individual country makes their own decision for which strains should be included in influenza vaccines licensed in their country. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determines which vaccine viruses will be used in U.S.—licensed vaccines.

[Source](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/virusqa.htm)

tl;dr 111 countries conduct year round surveillance on which strains are circulating that year. These labs send their data to 5 different World Health Organization research labs, and then WHO makes a recommendation on which strains should be vaccinated against. 

However, each country has the final say in which vaccines are produced in their borders.

"&gt; Chickenpox is a disease we all grew up with, to the point of being a part of childhood culture like Sesame Street, and for most of us the disease left little impact (maybe a small scar or two). 

I never got it as a kid, and subsequently voluntarily received the vaccine when i was around 10-12 years old. there is and was no need to mandate it. 

adults, the ones who actually die (I don't know how many fatal cases of non-complicated chickenpox there are among children, but I don't think it's many) can also receive the vaccine later in life. 

The same thing goes for Hep B. It's a disease that isn't easily transmissible (I received vaccines for that one too as an adolescent, and i seem to recall being told that you really couldn't get it unless you toyed around with infected blood, but I just got it anyways because I am cool with vaccines) especially among school-age children, and there isn't any adult-type ""shingles is really bad for you"" type issues. Yet it's also now required. ",PaulPocket,2015-02-07 13:34:01

"You're correct; chickenpox has a low fatality rate.  The vaccine came out in 1995.  [In the early 1990s, an average of 4 million people got chickenpox, 10,500 to 13,000 were hospitalized (range, 8,000 to 18,000), and 100 to 150 died each year. Most of the severe complications and deaths from chickenpox occurred in people who were previously healthy.](http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/surveillance.html).  I can see where the fatality rate would rise dramatically, however, when it becomes less likely to contract the disease as a kid (as is the case when there is a non-mandatory vaccination available).",Rukita,2015-02-07 13:54:57
"&gt; I can see where the fatality rate would rise dramatically, however, when it becomes less likely to contract the disease as a kid (as is the case when there is a non-mandatory vaccination available).

How does that follow? 

But anyways, that's kind of my point. Ok, we know that the disease can be fatal. 150 people died. Does that justify *mandating* it though? 

Again, it's the distinction between mandating it because the cost/benefit analysis says ""sure, why not"" versus mandating it to create herd immunity for problematic diseases. ",PaulPocket,2015-02-07 13:55:29
"The disease gets more deadly as you age.  Chickenpox exposure becomes rarer because fewer people get it now (because of vaccinations).  You are less likely to be exposed to it in childhood.  You are more likely to not get it until adulthood when it's deadlier.  Ergo, fewer people get it, but the ones who do are more likely to get very sick from it.

I'm not saying we should/shouldn't mandate it.  My original comment was to refute the idea that chickenpox is ""a disease ... [that] causes bad social outcomes"" because that implies that it's just a nuisance and not a real health concern, which I disagree with.  ",Rukita,2015-02-07 14:02:32

We do require (with voluntary exemptions, unfortunately) vaccines for CHILDREN who will be exposed to OTHER CHILDREN.

What exactly do you believe vaccines are?   It's essentially just priming your immune system to naturally fight disease.  The antibodies will exist whether you vaccinate or they get the illness,  the result is the same thing.  Except they never will get shingles as an adult. 

All a vaccine does is trick your body into thinking it's infected,  your natural immune system is what fights the disease.   This is why you don't get the same cold twice,  it reduces the lag time in your immune system to respond to the disease before it can take hold.   It's just to train your immune system,  but your immune system will end up with the same antibodies with orv without the vaccine. ",knoxxx_harrington,2015-02-07 23:58:40

"Vaccines don't work post exposure. The reason you vaccinate children when they are young is to minimize the possibility of exposure. 


Regarding chickenpox, it is like herpes... one you've had it, you have it for life. The virus stays dormant in your dorsal root ganglion of your nerves. As you get older, if you become immunocompromised, the virus can flare up and cause shingles - a very painful and debilitating condition.

I think most young parents who had chickenpox as a kid haven't experienced shingles yet so they don't really see the harm that requires the vaccine. I guarantee that if shingles hit people in their 20s, you'd see almost no resistance to the vaccine.


So as a parent, you can vaccinate your child against this and prevent the likelihood of a very painful, debilitating, and sometimes fatal disease that will follow them for the rest of their life or you can choose to not vaccinate and needlessly risk your child's health and well being.",68W2PA,2015-02-08 07:25:12

The neighborhood wasn't worth the investment from the city of a lousy $100 stop sign. Miraculously, those stop signs just started popping up one day after gentrification was well underway.

Wishes of RIP for a thriving black Alberta are certainly a little misguided. It was a baby planned to be stillborn.

Even the Clown House folks who were the first pioneers of a less-black Alberta were systematically moved through underhanded means when they were no longer useful to property values. The new neighborhood had the kindness to offer them their backyard back for one Thursday a month if they would be so kind as to put on a free show for the new residents, though. (They refused.)",ominous_squirrel,2014-04-14 18:10:14

"That comparison makes perfect sense in a world where racism doesn't exist but we live in a world where anti-immigrant racism is prevalent. Pro-Russian Crimeans owe consideration to their native neighbors just as Israelis and Palestinians owe consideration to each other. Those issues are complicated by race, religion and nationalism. 

Interstate transplants may bring less baggage but they also need to tread lightly and try to understand and adapt to the mindset of where they are moving.

Once we open up race as a concern, we might as well talk about gentrification throughout the city.

If you ever once say to yourself, ""I HATE this traffic, why don't they just add a freaking lane to I-84?!?"" then what you're really saying is, ""Bulldoze people's houses for my convenience!!"" 

""Why do people care about the CRC, just build it already!!!"" Same thing. People's houses literally torn down because once you add lanes on one side of a bottleneck, you gotta keep going until you reach City Center. Anything else is just moving the bottleneck. 

Portland has fought and lost battles for homes (Minnesota Freeway) and it has fought and won them (Mt. Hood Expressway). Portland is tired of fighting.

That's the concern behind Californication. Freeway design is only one of many battles that is fought and won or lost by a hair's breadth every few years when some ballot measure or city council resolution comes up (again!) about the urban growth boundary, sales tax, property tax, etc...

 You might be able to think of a recent debate where a longstanding Portland public policy decision was challenged for the umpteenth time and one side was painted nationally as progress-hating yokel hippy loons? Those of us who have lived in Portland for lengths of time know that *everything* that makes Portland unique gets challenged in that way, not just stuff you might think is dumb, and old values only have to lose once. 

Fluoride wasn't lost by one side misunderstanding science. Fluoride was lost by one side misunderstanding culture.

Same deal with the Williams bike lane debate. That neighborhood was dicked around by Emanuel Hospital for decades and decades. No kidding they were wary of change. Didn't matter that it was white kids on bikes instead of white hospital administrators in suits.

I grew up during Measure 5. I specifically and dramatically remember how my childhood changed when that passed.

This isn't about disliking Californians for being Californians, because we don't like the cut of their jib or something. This is about an Oregonian value that Tom McCall climbed out of his deathbed to defend in his smokestack speech. This is about seeing specific outcomes that are the consequence of unfettered growth and the dilution of the things that make Portland Portland.

I didn't link my references to Portland history because there should be a high bar for transplants. Transplants should be expected to learn the culture of where they move. A transplant should have curiosity about those things that are the foundation of why they moved in the first place. Born and raised Oregonians don't discriminate against people born in California. We discriminate against people who have Californian mindsets.

This ""review"" from Yelp smells like a bullshit scheme just attempting to sell greasy pieces of bread for $5 for almost pure profit (not counting labor) and ""say"" you're donating it which obviously may or may not be true, but is probably some story cooked up from the membrane of the brain stem of this coked out restaurant manager. /r/HailCorporate

I think getting offended by a joke like this IS being pretentious and overly PC.,NihlusKryik,2014-07-23 01:35:19
"I'm so tired of this ""too PC"" argument, it's such a copout that tends only to be used by people who are not of the group of people being disenfranchised (which like if you aren't a woman who has had an abortion who are you even to say that women who have had abortions don't have the right to be offended by a joke like this?). Political correctness is just another word for empathy, a specific kind of empathy where you realize that some people have shit to deal with that you don't have to.

Like nobody is saying that you can't make the joke, you have the freedom to make whatever jokes you want, but if they're offensive to a certain group of people that has less privilege than you, it's not ""edgy,"" it's just rude and you might get called out on it.

"That's not it at all... Are you a woman who has had an abortion? No? Then maybe nobody gives a shit about your opinion on whether or not this is offensive. Just because you are not personally offended by something does not mean that someone else can't be, or that their emotional reaction is invalidated. There is not some objective stamp of offensiveness. The deal with political correctness is simply listening to people when they say, ""okay, I know you meant this as a joke, but by the way, this is harmful to people like me for [x] reasons."" At that point it's up to you to decide either, ""oh, you know, I never thought about this person's experiences in this way before and the fact that they told me how this upsets them makes me think maybe I don't want to intentionally hurt them in a future just for a joke,"" or ""oh, you know, I don't give a shit and I think this joke is funny enough that hurting them is an acceptable consequence.""",thankylosaurus,2014-07-23 15:10:46

"Um, yeah, I do actually want to live in a world where people don't make tired, shitty jokes based on stereotypes that are harmful to oppressed groups of people.

Being a good person does mean you *do* have to actually take the time to think about the shit that comes out of your mouth. Think about who is the butt of your joke. Is it a black person? Are you, a white person, making fun of a black person based on stereotypes that you've never given a second thought to? Then maybe that joke isn't so funny. Maybe it's racist. Maybe a funnier joke would be to make fun of racists, since they are the assholes, and it's more likely to be a joke that takes actual thought rather than simply repeating a stereotype for the shock value.

You have a right to make whatever jokes you want, but if they are ""funny"" because of oppression and need oppressive systems to even make sense, maybe it's not that creative or funny of a joke. The point is to listen to people. If someone tells you ""hey, this hurts me when you say this,"" why do you really want to keep saying it?

&gt;I just think there are more important things to worry about than tiptoeing around issues because someone, somewhere might get offended.

That's a real nice way of saying ""I don't care about marginalized people and I don't want to think about it."" There's not some law of caring that you can only care *so much* - what, I think that women who have had abortions have a right to be offended about abortion jokes, how dare I possibly care about that when there are wars happening? 

If you think that avoiding hurting people is ""tiptoeing"" then I think you're probably not giving enough credit to their experiences. It only feels like ""tiptoeing"" if you've never tried to sympathize with the person being injured (it's real easy to say a slur for a cheap shock laugh without giving much thought to how people who have had those slurs violently thrown at them might feel hearing your dumb comment). This joke isn't the best example, but I see this logic applied so often to defend perpetuating harmful stereotypes and it's like why is it so important to you? Don't you think stereotypes are bad? Then why are you mad when someone decides not to let harmful language slide? If you personally don't care, that's your prerogative, but at the very least listen to people when they tell you that what you're saying is hurting them or people like them.",thankylosaurus,2014-07-30 00:42:55

You can laugh at a joke all you want, you can tell whatever the fuck jokes you want.

If someone explains that shit to you, and you still think your joke is more important than their real experiences as human beings, don't know what to tell you kid.

"If you want to get offended that's your right. But when you start labeling jokes like this as sexist and by extension that they shouldn't be used, that's putting your offense above their humor. That's pretty much textbook pretension. 

Virtually anything you could ever say can be construed as offensive to somebody, so what, they don't have the right to not be offended. If a person is offended by this joke that is a problem with them. Maybe they have a legitimate reason and perhaps therapy would help, but is ultimately their issue. That doesn't mean we can't be compassionate and considerate but if you try and throw ""isms"" at a person because they use a joke in a poor context you're being pretentious.

A good rule of thumb is if someone wasn't intending to offend you, you don't have good reason to be offended.

**Edit for clarification of my position** 

I'm also not saying that you can't respond but the manner in which you do is hugely important. 

Consider to possible responses.

#1 Hey, my sister just saw your review, she recently had an abortion and she's been pretty upset about it. She was starting to feel better but reading what you said brought back a lot of bad memories try if you could be more careful in the future I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

#2 This review is sexist and disrespectful towards women. It perpetuates harmful and potentially dangerous stereotypes. You shouldn't make fun of the real experiences of human beings, your shit joke isn't more important than the feelings of others.

Now of  course it's always subjective but hopefully you can see that response #1 is far less pretentious than response #2 and yet both responses accomplish the same goal, minimizing pain and suffering to ask risk individuals. The difference is that response #1 doesn't demand behavioral change. It simply makes the author aware that their are people who may be sensitive to the subject matter and to consider them when making similar attempts at humor in the future. This doesn't infringe on the persons ability to use shock humor but asks them to more carefully consider the context. It also maintains the moral high ground if the behavior persists.

Response #2 on the other hand ignores context it makes declarative statements about subjective things (whether or not a joke is sexist for example), it demands behavior change, and asserts that certain individuals feelings are more important than others in other words it's pretentious. It's also far less likely to be effective. Believe it or not people don't like being told what to do. The natural reply to response #2 is ""fuck you, who do you think you are."" Also by showing such a large rise to a comparatively minor joke it's  just begging to be trolled. ",Biohack,2014-07-24 09:39:42

And ultimately when it comes down to it, it doesn't even matter whether it review was sexist or not. If the purpose is to change behavior being uppity and pretentious is not an effective strategy, it  just invites trolling and a ""fuck you"" attitude.  ",Biohack,2014-07-24 18:26:51
"But it's not being ""uppity"" to ask for people to not treat you like shit for your gender, race or sexuality, especially when you're only asking that *if* they are going to speak authoritatively on the subject, they understand your concerns first.

I mean it boils down to interactions like this:

&gt; White person: Ugh, goddamn, if I only I was black I would get into so many colleges *har har har*

&gt; Black person: Well, actually the majority of scholarships go to white people, and a larger percentage of underqualified white applicants are accepted to colleges based on alumni connections than underqualified minorities are accepted due to quotas. Also black people are disproportionately likely to grow up in underfunded school disticts with lower test scores due to centuries of oppression that have caused black people to form communities in poorer areas, which means that scholarships for underprivileged minorities in particular are meant more to even the playing field and give opportunities to people who have the *potential* to succeed, even if poorer access to a good education has meant they have lower test scores, etc. coming in.

&gt; White person: Excuse me, did I ask you? Also I wasn't listening, and anyway I don't care. It's still reverse racism! Stop being so pretentious!

It's people speaking on subjects based on their gut feelings without taking any effort to understand the larger context of what they are talking about, or the experiences of those they are criticizing/stereotyping/making fun of. It's actually harmful because stereotypes and misconceptions based on factors like gender and race can lead to further violence and discrimination, even if they are perpetuated through ""jokes.""",thankylosaurus,2014-07-25 12:32:50

Typically you have to spray them with a selective broadleaf herbicide (triclopyr), and you'll need an applicators license. Anything you can buy at Home Depot (like glyphosate) is just going to deform it without killing it.

After we spray them we'll go back and cut everything down with saws. For huge patches we'll cut them down first and then spray. It's really the only way to do it without digging them up.

&gt;The **Midcontinent Rift System** (MRS) or **Keweenawan Rift** is a 2,000 km (1,200 mi) long geological [rift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift) in the center of the [North American continent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) and south-central part of the [North American plate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_plate). It formed when the continent's core, the [North American craton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_craton), began to split apart during the [Mesoproterozoic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoproterozoic) era of the [Precambrian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian), about 1.1 billion years ago. The rift failed, leaving behind thick layers of rock that are exposed in its northern reaches, but buried beneath later sedimentary formations along most of its western and eastern arms.

It puts innocent people in the situation of having to defend themselves for spending perfectly normal time on the internet pursuing interests, learning, and communicating.  

A huge problem with CISPA, and the main reason the President has said he will veto it, is because there is nothing in it to protect us from that scenario happening.

I don't even mean that in a bad way.  The lobby system does allow useful and worthwhile groups to have a word with officials.  That's where donation money for really wonderful groups goes to.

The Internet is incredibly organic and complex.  It's its own living system that represents a purely human (even the bots have programmers) experience.  Though for many people, it's simple the post office, the record player, and the movie theater delivered in some mystery format.  And you're not supposed to sneak into concerts and theaters.

The Internet is the ultimate example of freedom of speech and I believe it's outside of the scope of government to try and control it. Even if it was the U.N. (considering the Internet is not just the USA) I would think that the concept of free speech would speak louder.

The same can be said of most technology.

Because most people aren't annoying little twats who point out that someone is technically wrong when they call it Pennies...,absolutsyd,2012-12-01 22:26:15
"Nearly every native I know says ""Fred Meyer's"". Even in official adverts and marketing back in the day, Fred Meyer used to use ""You'll find it at Freddy's"" with the 's at the end. I'm guessing some people transferred that over to the long-form of the name.

Besides, it's not uncommon to tack the possessive morpheme onto people's names that are used as store names. A lot of stores do this voluntarily: GI Joe's, Shari's, Wendy's, Macy's, Koplan's etc. So doing the same thing with Mr. Meyer's name isn't all that weird. As for J.C. Penney, it even used to be called ""Penneys"" officially. Just like you could use the possessive's of someone's name to refer to their residence.

Penneys:

Sure, he doesn't technically own the store anymore and he's dead, but it still doesn't it make it incorrect to informally refer the store with a possessive form of Mr. Meyer's name to indicate the store associated with Mr. Meyer, just as it isn't incorrect to use a possessive form of Emma's name to refer to Emma's house.

"The forward to the Willamette Week ""Finder"" issue a few years back really captured why I feel this way, so I love to quote it to people...apologies for the formatting but this is pasted from a forum with weird text handling, I'll try to clean it up as best I can:  

&gt; **The Portland of 2011 is an 
&gt; unprecedented phenomenon: 
&gt; It is a curated city.** 
&gt;
&gt; More than any other major metropolitan area in the U.S., 
&gt; Portland is a city composed of handpicked ingredients. Even 
&gt; as Stumptown grows nationally remarkable for the things 
&gt; we make—beer, indie rock and green development spring to 
&gt; mind—we are even more distinctive for the refinement and 
&gt; panache with which we cull the things other places make. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dodge the puddles down any street in the city. Look in the 
&gt; windows. A coffee microroaster serves El Salvadorian and 
&gt; Sumatran blends, filling each mug with a pour-over ritual 
&gt; that turns brewing a cup of joe into performance art. Next 
&gt; door, a restaurant lists the name of every partner farm on a 
&gt; blackboard that stretches to the ceiling. Around the corner, a 
&gt; record store sells only vinyl, the shopping experience blurred 
&gt; and sharpened by three microbrew taps. In an empty lot 
&gt; nearby, a dozen food carts have planted themselves on the 
&gt; pavement, each specializing in a single dish, from chicken 
&gt; and rice to PB&amp;J. 
&gt; 
&gt; These activities (excepting the street food, naturally) take 
&gt; place in bright, jewel-like rooms of white paint and polished 
&gt; wood, often carved out of buildings erected well over a century 
&gt; ago. This Portland has been cut and polished in the past 
&gt; five years, and it sometimes looks like a living history museum 
&gt; of cool. The city you live in has been chosen for you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ironically, this was probably 
&gt; an accident.** 
&gt; 
&gt; To some degree, Portland’s curatorial ambition is the result 
&gt; of creative energy outpacing the means of production in a 
&gt; relatively isolated enclave: We are a long way from anywhere, 
&gt; and we got used to the idea that collecting objects 
&gt; from other places could become its own art form. In part, we 
&gt; are just following the examples of entrepreneurial godfathers 
&gt; Phil Knight (who made sneakers) and Dan Wieden (who 
&gt; made the ads that sold the sneakers), men who now use 
&gt; their money to show off the art they like. 
&gt; 
&gt; But mostly this culture is a consequence of a migration 
&gt; wave: the Great Flood of Creatives. Beguiled by Portland’s 
&gt; notorious liberalism and relaxed expectations—really, the 
&gt; impossibility of rejection or failure—college-educated young 
&gt; people elevated the city into a lifestyle destination in the 
&gt; mid-aughts, and haven’t stopped even though the talent pool 
&gt; has lapped the job market. It doesn’t matter why new people 
&gt; come here. It matters that they come here by choice. And 
&gt; they bring with them the things they like. 
&gt; 
&gt; **We know what you’re thinking. Go ahead and say it.** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hipster. Hipster. Hipster. 
&gt; Hipster. Hipster.** 
&gt; 
&gt; Best to get the dirty pejorative out of your system; it will do 
&gt; you no good here. It is essentially a pre-emptive defense 
&gt; against hurt, against the possibility you might be left out. At 
&gt; least you’ll have company: There are a lot of people in Portland 
&gt; who feel left out. 
&gt; 
&gt; The current burst of design and style runs counter to the 
&gt; city’s recent history as a haven for “fugitives and refugees,” 
&gt; to use Chuck Palahniuk’s memorable walking-tour phrase. 
&gt; Flophouse grunge is still very much in evidence, but “Keep 
&gt; Portland Weird”—a slogan stolen from Austin—has been 
&gt; eclipsed by Make Portland Utopia. Beneath this tug-of-war, 
&gt; Portland is still recovering from its past as a raw, strung-out 
&gt; outpost for the Northwest’s racists, pervos and cranks. If you 
&gt; want to find these people, just shout how much you love 
&gt; being gay on your bicycle. Then duck. 
&gt; 
&gt; Portland’s detractors—at least three of whom are arguing in 
&gt; good faith—will say the city has become inexhaustibly smug, 
&gt; that it doesn’t function nearly as well as it postures, that its 
&gt; artisanal dabbling is a symptom of aimlessness, and (most 
&gt; damningly) that it is a petri dish of unexamined privilege. 
&gt; There is no response to these arguments. Except this: 
&gt; 
&gt; **People in Portland are seeking 
&gt; beauty, and the search for beauty 
&gt; is always a gesture of hope.** 
&gt; 
&gt; It is for these people we have made this magazine. It is the 
&gt; seventh edition of Finder, but in many ways it is a new kind 
&gt; of guidebook for a new kind of city. In the pages that follow, 
&gt; we have created galleries of the finest items Portland has to 
&gt; offer in transportation, dining, nightlife, arts and recreation. 
&gt; We’ve made you mixtapes, clothing ensembles, a liquor 
&gt; cabinet, even a living room. We’ve asked some of Portland’s 
&gt; most creative and accomplished residents to give us tours of 
&gt; what makes their neighborhoods special. And we’ve picked 
&gt; our very favorite restaurants, bars, stores and activities. 
&gt; Finder has curated a city of curators. 
&gt; 
&gt; We hope you find it beautiful. But if you don’t—if you want 
&gt; this city to look different—it’s up to you to select a different 
&gt; culture to dominate. Portland isn’t going to happen by accident 
&gt; anymore. We need individual voices to change our direction; 
&gt; in many ways, we are more sensitive to such shifts 
&gt; than anywhere else, still young and self-conscious. The city 
&gt; has not ossified. The paint has not dried on our self-portrait. 
&gt; There is more to curate. 
&gt; 
&gt; Choose the city you want to live in. 
&gt;

"You have never dealt with the disturbingly large number of Americans who get really angry about any native American rights, especially reservations, have you. Here in Oregon/Washington there are heavy restrictions on salmon fisheries, one of the restrictions being that above a certain part of the river the only way to catch salmon is with rod and reel. Now because of Native Tribal sovereignty and the practice of allowing tribes to practice traditions regardless of the law, the gorge tribes are allowed to use nets, and use nets they do. But not only do they basically drag net 50% of the river width but they have no limit on catch, so at the end of a day in a large salmon run the tribe can walk away with seriously thousands of salmon taken. Now I am cool with that, I think they should be doing more conservation efforts, but it is their land, but some people around here fucking despise tribes for that. And that is one small example. 

My personal favorite is when people start bashing reservations talking about how we gave them ""all the good land"" and they basically ""love on a giant resort""(one Oregon drive has a huge vacation resort so that often comes up). I just want to slap those people and take them actually see the wasteland of poverty and neglect that is most reservation land.",aaomalley,2012-03-09 02:42:03
Have you seen how full the casinos are? They are getting their revenge and money back...,Kraker19,2012-03-09 09:57:00
"Longtime lurker here from Oregon and Walla Walla (Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla) living now in Portland, I feel compelled to dispel this myth that the Tribes have unlimited catch, they are allocated the same amount that the lower river commercial gillnetters (non-indian) are allocated which was determined by the court case  US. v Oregon: [usvoregon!](http://www.critfc.org/text/usvor.html).  I also think you may be exagerating a tad about the half of the river being dragged the Tribes can only fish the area known as [zone 6!](http://www.critfc.org/text/critfe/zone6.html) which is from Bonneville Dam to McNary Dam.  What most people think appears to be nets that are in year round but are actually white block or crab floats to claim that spot as a family fishing area so that other Tribal/non-Indian people do not fish there.  Also, the Columbia River is huge and this is in no way compares to the number of nets that used to be used by non-Indian fishers at the turn of the last century [Seine fishing!](http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/entry/view/seine_fishing/) which took up much more of the river than the gillnets that are used today.  Btw, the Tribes are doing lots of projects to restore waterways, salmon habitat, and fish runs but there's 150 years of ecological damage that was done which can take twice as long to repair[Restoration!](http://www.critfc.org/pcsrf/wtrsd_proj.html).  

One last thing, thanks for recognizing that there are still problems on the reservations even though we have casinos and such there's still a lot of work to undue the sticky problem of poverty, some things have improved so it's not all gloom and doom.  ",Smokey76,2012-03-10 01:00:23

I absolutely loved the carpet well before they were taking it out. I just had no reason to talk about it until they announced that they are getting rid of it. That is how this kind of stuff works...,deviantpdx,2014-06-21 16:12:41
"Exactly!


Very well articulated. 


Subconsciously it's always the first marker that meant home, but you would sound fairly daft talking about how much an old worn rug made you feel welcomed home. ",rotarypower101,2014-06-23 09:09:08
"That's a fair point, and I don't judge you for liking a carpet. That'd be silly. 

This is complete speculation but bear with me: I think people won't care once the new carpet goes in. It looks like PDX has opted for one of simliar green color, and that color is what I thnik is most imprtant when it comes to the carpet benig a symbol for home.

Kind of like I purposefully misspelled things in that previous sentence, and I'm guessing at least one of you guys didn't notice (and that a lot more of you picked up on at least one of those things). It's the symbol of the overall picture that are the Portlandness of the carpet, not the details.

Anyways, Portland Monthly Magazine has a sneak peek of the carpet, and it looks nice! It's a good update and is still pretty true to the old one. http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/travel-and-outdoors/tripster/articles/a-peek-at-pdx-airport-s-new-carpet-december-2013",,2014-06-21 16:19:58

"I don't think it's the ""everything we touch is gold"" so much as just a possessive nostalgia.

I think of it like Carl Sagan's story about when he went to the World's Fair with his dad. They packed a sack lunch, and he ate everything but an apple. Through the day he didn't want to eat it, but when his dad gave the apple to a homeless man, he started crying because it was *his* apple. Portland had a carpet, and now that it's being taken a way, it's waaay more important than it ever was.

If people like it so much, PDX should sell it. I'm completely serious. If you like it so much you'd get a tattoo of it, buy some for cheap and put it in your home or make a cat tower out of it. PDX can use the money towards a new carpet. It's a win-win. ""Put your money where your mouth is"", I guess, although that phrase's implication is harsher than my opinion. My only real, lasting opinion is it's honestly probably disgusting, and every time I travelled, I didn't even bat an eye at it until this ridiculousness went down.

Bagpipes alone are pretty easy. Not much harder than the recorder you played in elementary school. Unicycle and flames seen to bring a unique portland up kinda challenge. ,rangerjello,2014-05-04 21:16:55
Bagpipes are a very difficult instrument to master. The chanter (where the melodic notes come from) is pretty similar to the recorder but it's a small part if the instrument. It's a notoriously difficult instrument to keep in tune and the stamina required to play for an extended period takes years to build up. If you think that being able to hash out a tune on the recorder is all the talent you need to play the bagpipes (well) then you've obviously never played before. ,KiltedLady,2014-05-05 08:36:10

The raspberries produce, but I'm slowly replacing them with a variety I like better - from my grandma's yard.

But picking and choosing who is entitled to extra money based on some sort of arbitrary and shaming-based system that *only* serves to benefit the employers, not the employees or the consumers?

But why take it out on the driver? There is literally absolutely nothing we can do about it.

PS the tipping system doesn't only benefit the employers, it benefits you. Image a world where drivers are paid $15/hr, no tips. I know drivers who would leave with a delivery, go find a place to hide for 20 minutes and then deliver the pie, cold and 20 minutes late. It's the incentive for speed and tips that really pushes us to get to you quickly and get back for more deliveries. Not all drivers would be like this, but it would happen, and it would be hard to catch.

"&gt; why take it out on the driver

that is **exactly** what your employer wants you to ask. I don't understand why you're so set on making this into a employee versus consumer thing, when it's really an employer versus employee thing. that's what I'm talking about with the 'perspective' thing. yes, you would temporarily benefit from me paying you extra money now - but so would anyone any time, and it wouldn't *change* anything. rather than trying to change the system, you're actually supporting it, even though *you're* being doubly screwed by it - once as the employee and once as the consumer!

Tips for service are a good idea, they definitely are. But guilt-tripping consumers into not-really-mandatory-but-wink-wink-you'll-get-bad-service-if-you-don't is *not* the right thing to do. It only further supports the false employee versus consumer thing.

Tips are for people who make an extra effort, above and beyond their job description. They're not for someone just doing their normal job. I shouldn't be expected to pay someone extra for just driving from the pizza place to my house. It's their job. If it's during rush hour and they still make it over quickly, if they go out in the snow, something like that, then yeah, they deserve a few extra bucks. But if I decide I want a pizza at 8pm and I'm too lazy to drive 10 blocks? no way.

"&gt;you're already getting paid to do that.

Okay, but in America, you AREN'T getting paid by your boss to do that - your income relies on the service you provide and the wage is paid by people who use the service. 

What if I told you not EVERY person in the service industry hates tips - when I was working for tips I would make **B A N K** on a good day, way more than my boss would have paid me. Sometimes I made more than *management* because of tips. 

Bartenders, strippers, and high end restaurant servers all generally make MORE than the average hourly worker *if they do a really good job.* 

So, tips are a dual-edged sword - sometimes you get fucked and don't have a great day, other times you get a lot more. In the end, it averages out to about the same.

"&gt; Dude, other telcos are already doing this

The city (of Portland) just made some big exceptions to its existing rules for Google. My understand is some of the utilities you see in the suburbs aren't present in Portland because of this (in addition to utility poles) but I may be wrong. I know what a lot of these things look like and ""obstructive"" or not is subjective. Some people think utility poles are obtrusive but I like them, a lot of the streets don't have the random electrical and broadband utilities dotting the street instead are above.",,2014-06-11 22:01:14
"I definitely expect other telcos to follow and add field cabinets.

Remember when [a car took out a TriMet cabinet](http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2012/10/trimet_max_riders_wonder_how_s.html)? That type of things gets expensive fast, especially if fiber is involved.

I don't buy your suburbs vs. dense city argument. Go walk around downtown, you'll see big traffic signal cabinets on every corner and a smaller meter cabinet nearby - all in the public right of way. There's about 1,100 of these in Portland not counting meter cabinets, street lighting cabinets, PGE/PPL transformers, and all sorts of other cabinets owned by other agencies (ODOT, counties, other Portland departments). Compared to the 200 Google is asking for. Most of those also have footprints significantly larger than Google's cabinets.",Vincent_LeRoux,2014-06-11 20:13:09

I prefer dedicated rail to street cars, because I like having mass transit not have to sit/contend with congestion, but at this point, the bus is getting increasingly unattractive and I think we'll see more dedicated rail developed as a result of fuel costs rising.

If just going at slightly less than half the lumens of the original, my design would require 600+ watts to operate, which is a fairly decent sized solar panel (and battery packs too).

A 3 Watt LED can provide about 80 lumens (which is roughly half the output of a 25watt incandescent bulb, but with that many bulbs it probably doesn't need more than that...I'll have to look up some tables for light values for pedestrian scale lighting).

If going with 3 Watt LEDs in the same number as the current arch, only 600 Watts of power could be the minimum draw. That's really not too bad.

From [this article on the arches](http://www.cafeunknown.com/2009/03/rise-and-fall-of-great-light-way-1890s.html) the light power and bulb composition is given. The 3 Watt LEDs I propose would be a lot softer than the 40 Watt configuration of the original (but the original was probably overkill...200 bulbs@40 watts each is a lot of lumens).

Obviously, if I were to actually dedicate time to designing this with any seriousness beyond just some generic specs, I'd try to find LEDs with the best power to output to price ratio.

DLC has plenty of LEDs (a quick search netted 350 results) down at the 30-50 lm/w rating, so I don't think they exclude LEDs below 70 lm/w.

* Was the shooter actually in a crowd of people?

* Was the hypothetical CCW holder also in a crowd of people?

"Yep, then I go, ""but fire extinguishers don't have a higher statistical probability of killing their owner or owner's family member than putting out a fire."" And then we continue the dance...

"Basically, it is true that you can ""fight fire with fire"", just like you can stop a gunman with a gun.

Likewise, just because you have a gun doesn't mean you are properly trained to use it in a tense, chaotic situation.",harmala,2012-12-13 08:33:44
"Lemme get this straight: Just because a person isn't trained to fight fires in some professional respect means that they shouldn't even try to fight a fire if one breaks out right in front of them?

"Yes, they should try to stop it. They probably shouldn't stop it *using fire*, though, unless they have extensive training. They should probably use a safer method. Likewise, shooting a gun in a crowded mall is not a sane, safe way to stop a gunman, unless you are highly trained for that situation.

And, in almost every dangerous situation, it is better to flee than try to be a hero. Sure, you might save the day, but you could also make things much, much worse. What if you put out a fire without ventilating properly, and the resulting smoke kills more people than the fire would have had it burnt a little while longer?

"I've actually participated in active shooter trainings with CCSO.  They, along with the local municipal agencies (Milwaukie, Gladstone, Lake O, etc) have a standing policy that's pretty much in line with the nationally-accepted active shooter response.  Which is that the first 2-4 officers on scene throw on an extra vest, grab their duty rifle, and go in immediately after the shooter.  They do not stop to interview witnesses, they do not stop to render aid to the wounded, they go to the sound of gunfire and neutralize the threat, period.  Having played the ""bad guy"" against them numerous times, I can attest to their abilities and speed.  You don't want them coming after you, they will get you.

the correct term for semi-automatic civilian variants with high ammunition capacity is supposed to be **assault-style weapon** not *assault-type*. and *assault rifle* isn't an entry, instead it's suggested that you use *automatic* or even *machine gun* to specifically talk about weapons capable of automatic fire.

(i disagree with the *machine gun* entry. their text example is ""a .30-caliber Browning machine gun."" which makes it sound like *machine gun* should be reserved for vehicle-mounted weapons, or weapons that are stabilized on the ground rather than at the shoulder.)

but like i said in another post, the point of the different terms is to communicate different capabilities to the reader. as far as i've read in the last few years of national news shooting stories and news about the wars, assault rifles are select-fire rifles while assault-style or assault-type specifically refer to the semi-automatic (though still high-capacity, high-powered) civilian variants.

The pro gun lobby tries to say AR-15's and AK-xx's aren't ""assault rifles"" when clearly they are. 

I'm a gun enthusiast as well, but we need to be realistic. An AR-15 is an assault rifle. A lot of parts are made with the same molds and on the same lines as military production rifles. Hence the grenade launcher cut out on civilian AR-15 barrels. The pro gun lobby is trying to distance military weapons and civilian weapons, but the only difference is the trigger group. ",chechnyatx,2012-12-12 12:00:15
"The trigger group is kind of a big goddamn difference.  Otherwise, it's nothing more than a Mini-14 with some external doo-dads.  Having selective fire is a major mechanical and operative change compared to semi-auto.  For example, [this](http://hammerbackguns.com/images/MINI-14-BLK-LAMINATE.jpg) is a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle.  It is not an assault rifle.  [This](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/ar15.jpeg) is also a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle.  It is also not an assault rifle.  Just because it looks scary doesn't mean it's in any way different in the way that it shoots things.

And before you bring up the capacity argument, extended magazines exist for just about everything, including bolt-action hunting rifles, semi-automatic rifles, select-fire assault rifles, battle rifles, pistols, sub-machine guns, and even shotguns.",Osiris32,2012-12-12 18:51:20

edit: Oh, I see what you mean now. Well yes, if *more* people learn about it ... but we're talking about a shooting that absolutely everyone in the Portland area, if not the nation, will know about by tomorrow. The amount of coverage it receives is related to the number of people who hear about it, but all I've heard people bitch and moan about is the amount of detail, so as not to ""glorify"" the shooter.

"they're semi-automatic, magazine-fed variants of military assault rifles. a common example in the US is the Colt AR-15.

it's *assault-type* because *assault rifles* are select-fire rifles like the select-fire AR-15 (the M16) or the AK-74. assault rifles could also include bullpup and larger machine pistol variants like the H&amp;K MP5. basically, if it's capable of automatic fire and used by soldiers, *assault rifle* will accurately convey the capability of the weapon.

the whole point of the different terms for different firearms is to differentiate capability to the reader. just saying *rifle* is vague and could include everything from muzzle-loaders to bolt-action to magazine-fed. while immediately jumping to use *assault rifle* is misleading and an overstatement of the type of weapon involved.",sgt_wu,2012-12-12 01:08:11

Usually when somebody breathlessly reports the use of an 'assault-type' weapon they do so in order to imply (by design or by ignorance) that the streets run rife with select-fire capable firearms.

&gt;

&gt;In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking), __IP over Avian Carriers__ (IPoAC) is a humorously-intended proposal to carry [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (IP) [traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_traffic) by [birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) such as [homing pigeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homing_pigeon). IP over Avian Carriers was initially described in __RFC 1149__, a [Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) (RFC) issued by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF) written by D. Waitzman and released on April 1, 1990. It is one of several [April Fools' Day RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_RFC).

&gt;Waitzman described an improvement of his protocol in __RFC 2549__, *IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service* (1 April 1999). Later, in __RFC 6214__ released on 1 April 2011, and 13 years after the introduction of [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6), Carpenter and Hinden published *Adaptation of RFC 1149 for IPv6*. 

&gt;IPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data, with a [packet loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss) ratio of 55% (due to user error),  and a [response time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_time_(telecommunications\)) ranging from 3000 seconds (~54 minutes) to over 6000 seconds (~1.77 hours). Thus, this technology suffers from poor [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering\)). Nevertheless, for large transfers, avian carriers are capable of high average throughput when carrying flash memory devices, effectively implementing a [sneakernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet). During the last 20 years, the information density of storage media and thus the bandwidth of an avian carrier has increased 3 times faster than the bandwidth of the Internet.  IPoAC may achieve bandwidth peaks of orders of magnitude more than the Internet when used with multiple avian carriers in rural areas. For example: If 16 homing pigeons are given eight 32 GB SD cards each, and take an hour to reach their destination, the throughput of the transfer would be 9102 Mbit/s, excluding transfer to and from the SD cards.

"I think this would be preferable to the system Extreme Pizza used.

The only other option is to set up a fairly complicated website and internal order tracking system. Even then I personally don't use them because they mostly suck. This is coming from a guy who was the first to use online banking and switch all my bills over to paperless. But for ordering at restaurants, online stuff just sucks.

I'm fucking sick of people who talk shit like you. You think you can make it and there's a market for it? Fucking do it or shut it.

You won't do it because you don't know shit about what they want to do with their restaurant. Personally I think they'll either tell you that they've seen similar systems that didn't help them at all, or they'll tell you they are very happy with their current system and to get lost. 

But you know better, right? Go make money and prove me wrong.",FountainsOfFluids,2015-02-09 00:13:57

"I said you can do it. You said you couldn't do it, that if you could it would be everywhere, suggesting you think there's obviously a market. I said that's fallacious reasoning and described how to do it and you came back talking shit about me and telling me I should go into business because YOU think every restaurant would want one.

Look, there's a difference between proving that the technology is possible and putting my life on hold to try to start a business doing something. Don't dismiss me demonstrating that something is possible just because I haven't decided to make a career out of selling it. I was only trying to demonstrate that an electronic system that's a little more flexible than faxing could work. I could invest hours making a prototype, I could invest days trying to market it to someone, I could invest years trying to make a living off it, but even the minutes wasted demonstrating to you that it is possible was a waste of time, because you can't take being proven wrong graciously. You had to go on the offensive, try to take me down a peg because you couldn't stand that someone made a suggestion that was relevant but also proved you slightly wrong. If you think there's a market for something that goes ping or prints out emails, then be my guest, and do that. There are probably fax machines that will print emails automatically, even. [You can even set Outlook up to do it automatically.](http://email.about.com/od/mozillathunderbirdtips/qt/et_auto_print.htm) You set up a printer, you set up a desktop that has Windows installed, you follow an online tutorial; any high school kid with half an inclination to use computers could do this. Again, I'm just demonstrating how easy it would be to make something that has the advantages you suggested order-by-fax has, but also lets you do it by email, before you go off on another angry rant about how people proving you wrong on the internet are worthless blowhards who don't know what they're talking about.",Bobshayd,2015-02-09 01:37:05
"Ok, this conversation went off on a slight tangent. Yes, I can see that it is possible to make a system where emails will print out automatically and/or make a noise.

My main point is that such a system is not desirable for small restaurants in the same way that a fax menu is. It is obvious that it is not desirable because then somebody would be doing it everywhere, and nobody would be taking orders from offices by fax.

I apologize for my rant, and more importantly for not noticing that the conversation had deviated from my main point.",FountainsOfFluids,2015-02-09 01:48:49

No, it really is that easy. Like, fifteen minutes if you want the dirty version. It's seriously easy.

"There is a little bit of truth in some of the stuff they have to say, usually. Societal norms change constantly, and what is generally accepted as ""masculine"" now is far less ""kingly"" I suppose, but they usually get lost in their own spirals. I would assume for many of them it ends up being a different road that leads them into their little worlds. 

The ones I've been near enough to follow have been much like any other false world, they are pushed out of groups or not considered a viable mate by their peers for what other people would clearly see about them, but they lack the self reflection to see their own fault. Instead, they end up spiraling into the belief that the world is somehow against them and every rejection they face with the notion that it isn't their fault, but the world or society at large. They blame this problem, whatever they decided it was, and their lens of the world shifts to nothing but this problem, the thing that they think is the reason they are rejected. They become hostile, putting up their shield of belief before they even have a chance to become rejected, taking any rejection after that as more proof of their belief. It isn't their fault they are single, it isn't their fault they can't get a job, it isn't their fault the world doesn't seem to agree with them, but they are sure they are right.

The next step, if they haven't already found a group that felt the same and accepted them, they will seek one out usually. Feeling right is hard when no one else agrees with you. Depending on how far along they are, they either begin to agree with people further down in the spiral, and take a couple steps that way, or they just get positive reinforcement from others.

Anyway, I've explained this for far too long now, but I wanted to end with the idea that this is fairly common, and is not specific to one gender or ideology. Most of them have some kind of good point somewhere in there about something that the world would be a better place if fixed, but good luck getting just that out of them. In my opinion, this is where many of the ""girls don't like me 'cause I'm too nice,"" and ""I'm always stuck in the friendzone"" people end up coming from.",Unit4,2013-04-07 22:34:42

"No, but i can tell you where to find some.

Go to a coffee shop near the main road/highway at about 7 AM. They'll be coming in for their coffee on the way to work.

Go hiking out in logging-land. Try areas like the Siuslaw. Hit up local little cafes and diners afterward for a beer and a sandwich. They'll be in there, after work, killing time.

Head to the places where people who work their asses off tend to be. They're not out at bars. If they're single, they're not at home with the kids right after work- they're out someplace having their beer and sandwich or whatever.

Daytime is best time to find them. Outdoors is best. But in a pinch, you can go to Coastal and look for them in the live baby bird section in springtime, trying hard not to get all squee'd out over the quail and shit when they really only came there for some case oil.


ETA: they all drive pretty shitty cars/trucks, by the way. the only real problem is finding ones who are well-read/left-leaning, but I've had really good luck so far. The logger I dated was a feminist who liked to read about WWI and philosophy, the guy I dated who liked to rebuild transmissions after he got home from ditch-digging really enjoyed sci-fi novels and was even more lefty than me.

"I always wonder what my friends are thinking, looking for ""decent guys"" at the bar...or wherever people with no job go at night

I've gone  bar-hunting but only for plain old fucking. if you want someone to hang out with who won't be up your ass, you've got to find someone with shit to do.

and somehow to make sure the shit they have to do isn't a partner/kids. so, you have to go the places at the times they'd be there. I used to work manual labor wayyyy back in the day. I'd go get coffee and a donut at the same damn place that was on my way to work every morning around 7 or 8. hang out and munch for about fifteen minutes. then work all day. get off work, go grab a quick beer and a sammy at a local place. then home. 

weekends I might be anyplace at all, but weekdays it's that predictable. If you go to a place and see a guy with an old truck buying a cup of black coffee with his callused-up manhands one morning, and you think he's hot, and he doesn't have any horrid bumper stickers that scare you...then go there a few days a week in the morning, until you're familiar enough to go up and say hi to him, and strike up some talk.

It's a more human way to approach someone too than in a loud bar full of idiots. I mean, you just say, ""Hi, I saw you here before. Do you work nearby?"" or ""you're pretty handsome, are you taken?""

simple as pie. manly men like that shit.


ETA: guys who are not out right before/after work probably have a lady at home already, dinner or beer and a sammy is waiting there, so they don't head to food right after work. many people with partners also bring their own coffee made at home, a lot of couples like those few minutes together in the morning. it's not like a hard and fast rule but for the most part, people getting a beer right after work in their work clothes, or coffee on their way in regularly, are single.",resonanteye,2013-04-08 11:44:57

"When some guys take a rough tumble through their early life socially or otherwise, it's very easy to look back at past decades and find a lot that's very appealing about the rigid social roles and stratification of the 50's or beyond. It's understandable if not necessarily tolerable. These guys have generally had a rough go of it socially, sometimes for reasons that aren't entirely their fault, but more often for reasons that are almost completely their fault. We're living in a time when differences in behavior and opinion are more acceptable than they would have been twenty years ago, much less fifty years ago. Figuring out how to communicate across those differences can be tricky for the best of us. For those of us who don't have the gift of gab, this kind of communication looks like something inherent and impossible, equivalent to playing basketball like Lebron James, or singing like John Legend. 

These guys look at bygone eras and see what they think are codified and universal systems of behavior, rules that if followed would allow them to navigate the tricky worlds of dating, socializing, business, etc. It's an appealing fantasy, that you could just lay out a social formula that everyone would follow and that all this confusion would dissipate and that these poor, socially awkward fellas would be recognized for the shining diamonds that they actually are. In reality, of course, most of these systems were designed to keep women subjugated and to promote white, Protestant men at the expense of better qualified minorities. The social conventions that they look back on are rigid because the personalities and opinions that they allow are equally rigid.

In addition, any of the positive aspects of that old-school masculinity that this crowd embraces are done as an act of self-aggrandization. You embrace toughness because it means (maybe) that you're tougher than everyone else. Self-reliance, protection of the weak, belief in self, all of the old and actually positive principles of masculinity are not embraced out of necessity, but because they let someone tell themselves that they're better than someone else. It's an act of faking confidence instead of actually earning it.

And I get the sense that they're still not understanding a lot of what makes that old school male ideal attractive. This kind of thing tends to center around guys who are almost more cartoon characters than actual people. It's a lot more Jack Palance than, say, Gregory Peck. ",croc_lobster,2013-04-08 15:02:50

"Gender roles these days are confusing, particularly in the dating world.  If you look to other cultures with much more pronounced gender roles, the whole equation for men is pretty simple - be somewhat attractive and able to support a family and you are pretty good to go as a man in the dating world.  Of course, for the women it's absolute shit for choice as it's difficult to alter your social standing or how attractive you are.  Honestly, the narrow field of choices for all involved makes the whole process of finding a mate simpler and you can see how some would reminisce, probably overly fondly, for a time when it wasn't so difficult to be whatever is successful.

Now, we live in a society where those gender roles are in transition.  The side effect is that it can be confusing - one woman might expect for you to provide for a family while she stays home and takes care of the house while the next expects to have a career, raise kids and travel the world all at the same time.  There are some valid issues that the new roles of society haven't quite answered yet.  Women get stuck trying to fill two full time roles at once - career and family woman.  For a lot of women it leads to unnecessary stress as she feels that she's expected to succeed at both or be a failure.  Another issue is raising the kids.  I'm sure I'm not alone in wondering if sending the kids off to daycare and school while both parents work is really a society headed in the right direction.

We'll get there eventually.  I'm sure that eventually being a stay-at-home dad will become a much more respected position and hopefully the societal pressure for women to be primarily responsible for family will ease.  In any event, if you want a great demonstration of gender roles at work, try imagining a man telling his date that he'd like to quit working when they have kid in order to take care of them.  Even a feminist would probably choke on her coffee listening to that one.

Then you get to the issues of success and all that entails.  Women expect to marry up, the speech given recently about getting married at Princeton is pretty revealing.  If women always expect to marry up, and are on average more successful than men (57% of bachelor's degrees go to women) then you are simply going to have a mismatch of expectations that is going to cause some angst as it gets sorted out.",Enphuego,2013-04-08 09:59:42

""6 Reasons Why Portland Sucks For Single Men
By Matt Forney

I relocated to Portland from my hometown of Syracuse, New York last year as part of a cross-country trip to see America and change my life. While I like the place—there are a lot of cool people and things to do here—Portland is not a city for everyone, and it’s definitely not a place you want to go to get laid. Here’s why…

1. The weather is miserable.

Seeing as I grew up in the snowiest large city in the U.S., I figured dealing with the weather in the Pacific Northwest would be easy. I was wrong. In the winter, Portland’s stretches of rainy or overcast weather are so long that you’ll start to forget what the sun looks like. From the time I arrived in December all through January, there were maybe two or three days total that the city wasn’t blanketed in gray storm clouds. I’m pretty confident that the lack of sunshine—and the resulting depression caused by Vitamin D deficiency—is partly responsible for Portland’s lazy “yeah, whatever man” culture.

2. The city is bum central.

I’m not exaggerating when I say Portland is full of bums, and I’m not talking about the hipsters. Thanks to the mild winter weather and limp-wristed police force, PDX has a huge population of homeless people. Hell, this city was where the term “skid row” originated. When they aren’t sucking down free meals from the Rescue Mission, Portland’s transients are either panhandling for smack money down at Pioneer Courthouse Square or pacing back and forth on the Burnside Bridge muttering the n-word to themselves. Because the city council lacks so much as one vertebra of backbone, their “solutions” to the homeless problem consist of letting them fare jump on the MAX and loiter in the Central Library all day, which now has a permanent funk of B.O. and dried urine.

3. The women are overweight and/or unhealthy looking…

Portland is supposedly one of the fittest cities in America, but you wouldn’t know it by actually visiting here. The average Rose City girl either has a beach ball-shaped body or looks like an Auschwitz survivor; nothing in between. Add in their pasty flour dough skin and you can go days without seeing anything you’d want to bang. And like Toronto girls, Stumptown’s womenfolk have a disturbing obsession with stuffing their faces, as evidenced by quirky local eateries like Voodoo Doughnut and the absurd number of late-night food trucks littering downtown.

4. …and the few that aren’t look like Mad Max extras.

Because hipsters lack any semblance of imagination, they always choose to express their “individuality” in the most hackneyed ways possible: getting inked and pierced. Most girls here are covered in tacky tattoos and have enough studs in their faces to set off metal detectors. Additionally, they love dyeing their hair in ridiculous clown colors and cutting it short Skrillex-style. If you regularly jack off to the BBW section of Suicide Girls, you’ll be in hog heaven in Portland; guys who like slender, feminine women need not apply.

5. Nobody wants to talk to you…

You’d think a city half-comprised of people from other states would be more welcoming, but nope. Portland is hands-down one of the snobbiest and most cliquish places I’ve ever lived in. Try to make small talk with people and they’ll act like you have chronic halitosis. Attempt to cold approach any girl, including the fat ones, and they’ll treat you like you’re an axe murderer. Even waitstaff and cashiers treat you with a rudeness that would get them fired anywhere else in the country, because they think their master’s degree in Cephalopod Sexuality makes them superior to the hoi polloi.

I can hear Portlanders protesting, “Girls don’t want to talk to you because you’re creepy/ugly/only interested in sex!” They’ll have to explain why in other Portland-esque cities like Madison, Wisconsin or Burlington, Vermont, women—and people in general—are eager to chat up out-of-towners like myself. Even in Williston, North Dakota, a city so overcrowded with men that fat girls are referred to as “Williston 10s,” hot girls were kinder and more polite to me than Portland fatties.

From what I can tell, there are only two ways for a normal man to get laid in this city without paying for it: either start a mediocre indie rock band and bang groupies, or wait for a fat girl to get so horny that she tries to rape you. Bars and clubs in Portland are like abstract art exhibits: full of grotesque objects that you’re not allowed to touch.

6. …and they have nothing interesting to say anyway.

“The city where young people go to retire” is not an exaggeration. Portland truly is a magnet for people who want to do nothing with their lives at all. If you can find one of the few girls who isn’t an antisocial weirdo, all she’ll do is repeat feminist cliches or lay down obnoxious sarcasm until your dick shrinks to the size of an olive. She’ll be happy to bloviate about her made-up sexual orientation—pansexual, demisexual, polyamorous or whatever—all day, but she’ll have absolutely no interest in what you have to say.

For example, whenever I brought up the fact that I hitchhiked here all the way from New York (which most normal people think is pretty interesting), the typical response from girls was a nonchalant “Yeah, that’s cool.” Meanwhile, their greatest achievements in life consist of operating an espresso machine five days a week for minimum wage and selling handmade doilies on Etsy.

I’m not trying to bash Portland as a whole. This city’s got a lot going for it: the variety of microbrews, the music scene, the lack of crime, and the low cost of living, among other things. But there’s no denying that the girls here are dumpy-looking, have nasty attitudes and are just plain boring to talk to. If you’re looking for love—or just a lay—you’re best served going somewhere else.""

I'm not under the illusion that some pejoratives are completely problem-free and others are just mortal sins.  These things exist on a continuum.  But in my book, at least, *jackoff* and *fuckwad* are way less problematic than *cunt*.

If someone laid out a convincing, sensical case for either of those being more generally harmful, I'd reconsider.  I've done that with *gypped*, and I'm open to others.",cincodenada,2013-04-07 23:03:12

Which is to say, the most ineffectual loser possible, a waste of space, a waste of time, worthy only of a brief chuckle, then to be forgotten forever.

I have friends from high school with more twitter fans than you.  They aren't trying to be internet celebrities though, they're just regular people with regular jobs but it just-so-happens that what they have to say is insightful and entertaining, whereas what you have to say is more of the same drivel that makes men look like sub-evolved neanderthals, you are the reason negative stereotypes towards men exist. 

&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say, if I had to boil my point down, is this: Keep doing what you're doing.  Not because you're funny, or clever, or masculine, or offer good advice... but because you're a trainwreck.  You're so hopelessly pathetic that I simply cannot look away, I am so enthralled in the spectacle that I must know what other stupid shit will fall like a turd from those thin pursed lips on your needlessly smug, polished little head.

You record it on videotape after a lengthy monologue and stream it to the internet.  It will be posted to reddit.com/r/funny, and will make the front page.  You will finally achieve the internet stardom you've been working towards for so long, but we won't be laughing with you, my friend. We'll be laughing at you.  We've ALWAYS been laughing at you.

How does one convey these actions in an urban setting?  Again, this is an honest question.

This ban is tough to enforce but it's easier than litter laws. And like litter laws it's more symblic than practical.

I think people -- particularly smokers -- are in great denial to the extent of this problem. Go out for a walk in anywhere in Portland and the cigarette butt litter is just extraordinary. Some smokers are responsible for their habit but so many more are not.

"&gt; Granted, there are people that don't give a fuck, but having removed ash trays from public places has only made the litter problem worse.

I've never bought this theory. For one, I see ashtrays in town with butts just strewn about them and not even close the cigarette receptacles. Two, people who litter their trash (cigarette butts are trash but differentiating here) won't seek out many of the very obvious and ubiquitous trash cans around town.

Some cities like Tokyo, trash cans are barely even provided if non at all for (terrorist reasons). Tokyo is an incredibly clean city.

It's almost comical sometimes, if not downright fucking infuriating. I'm at the Convention Center MAX/Bus stop quite often and there's always trash just left everywhere on the benches and ground -- yet there's two (maybe even three trash cans conveniently placed at that location. People literally leave their items 3 feet from the receptacle for the wind to take it where it wants. It's almost like you have to try to litter and not be responsible.

It's erroneous to think that a lack of trash cans leads to littering. People who do not litter never will. Ever. I go hiking and don't just throw my trash in Multnomah Falls. I hold onto it.

I pick up trash and litter in my free time because I'm lame. It'a always fast food, cigarettes, and miscellaneous junk food. Garbage in-Garbage out. I now support a very small sales-type tax on all to-go food packaging that goes towards ameliorating the problem we call human habitation. We are disgusting and we should be paying to clean it up. Our oceans are just embarrassing.

"I think you're discounting the social interaction smokers have with one another and the tacit behaviors that are picked up and carried forward. I think I asked a simple question if smokers talked about litter of their butts ever? It's a genuine and reasonable question.

I'm still steadfast on this: if smokers could self-regulate more and understand their habit has major affects on other people than themselves, the jihad on smoking wouldn't be an issue today.

Smokers have always been selfish with their habit, and everything in life seems to have an opposite and equal reaction. We're just fighting to regain control. If you don't think the litter is a problem, then you're blind. It is much more ubiquitous than food litter. And it gets into the environment easier too.

&gt; No? That's because the litter is just a thinly veiled excuse to regulate a behavior people don't like.

I have no other issue with smokers other than litter except for their exorbitant health care costs that get pushed onto non smokers. If I didn't like a smokey (private bar) I just didn't go, I was free to enjoy a smoke-free environment somewhere else.

"&gt; it doesn't address the fact that a law already exists and isn't enforced

The law exists and isn't enforced for a lot of reasons. In particular, with cigarette litter, it's easy to smoke and then just toss the butt on the ground without anyone noticing -- from the law to the general public. Even with really good enforcement it wouldn't stop someone from littering very well. 

With this ban, you can spot a smoker a good 100 feet away (guesstimate). This smoking ban is actually much easier to enforce than the litter law. It also has the effect of other people seeing people smoke and having the public's perception casting on them.

It's not as difficult to enforce as people say it is. Litter laws are way more difficult. It's easy to litter, it's no so easy to get away with smoking when there's hundreds of people around seeing you do it. People are avodiing this.

&gt; I'm also a huge fan of the butt deposit idea.

Butt deposit I think sounds good on paper but is just unrealistic. For one, the deposit for cans and other recycling raw goods has actual value (ie., they can be turned into goods and people buy these raw goods).

Cigarettes don't yield enough plastic. I don't believe the economics are there.

Tobacco itself absolutely affects public health.

I'd put money on the vast majority of casual litter being cigarette butts.  You said that we don't ban Slurpee cups, but if the parks were littered with them I bet the city would ban Slurpee consumption in the parks as the best way to clean them up.

When it comes to litter yes cigarette butts are there but food wrappers, beverage bottles, bags(may it be plastic or paper), disposable silverware/straws all, are part of litter.  Which all of these items are used by most patrons of parks. 

If this was a litter issue then the law would also include bringing/using anything disposable with you into the park. It should be put on everyone not just smokers.  Make everyone have to bring reusable bags, silverware, water bottles and such, then there would not be this issue where it seems that the government wants to segregate smokers.

"Citations are over-rated, let's think for ourselves for a second here.

With a little math I think we can model the exposure of sharing a closed, sealed room with a smoker, and then we can extrapolate those effects to an open air environment:

In a 20 by 20 by 10 foot room there is 4000 cubic feet of air.

A full lung of air is 6 liters.  There are 28 liters in a cubic foot.  The average cigarette is smoked in 8-10 drags.  

Assuming full lungfuls (overestimate) that's 3 cubic feet of smoke the smoker inhales, which is then diluted into the 4000 cubic feet of air the sealed room contains.

Meaning the air you inhale is ~1/1200  as ""potent"" or ""less diluted"" as what the cig smoke smoker inhales, per breath.

The high end of human breaths per minute is 20, so assuming full, deep breaths, that's over an hour of hyperventilating in a sealed room to equal the exposure to one cigarette.

This is in a sealed room.

So I'm fairly comfortable predicting that it's extremely difficult to get any medically significant dosage of anything in the open air unless you were surrounded by a ring of smokers who were intentionally and continuously exhaling in your face.",Herner_Warzog,2015-02-18 22:08:50

Let's say that I was rushed in the morning and didn't have time for my breakfast or my medicine. Now, if I go to lunch and walk through a cloud of smoke, I will most likely start to have a seizure.

&gt;Reports of accidental ingestion of cigarettes (and butts) are not uncommon among children, especially those &lt;6 years old. Most reports and reviews of cigarette and butt ingestion have described few significant toxic responses or sequelae among children to cigarette or butt consumption (table 1), but some have shown severe toxicity with as few as two cigarettes consumed.17

&gt;Reports of nicotine ingestion in domestic animals are rare; however, this ingestion can cause excessive salivation, excitement, tremors, vomiting, lack of coordination, weakness, convulsions, respiratory failure and even death.

Disposables are designed to the same form factor, but only two brands look remotely like actual cigarettes - Njoy and Marlboro.  The lack of smoke coming off the device itself is a good indicator that it's not an actual cigarette, if you're not a complete idiot.

Tobacco is far from the 'most popular flavor' of liquid, as a quick look around any of the myriad vape shops around Portland will show.  There's no ""e-cig gel"" in existence.

I just found it a bit of an odd/almost laughable interaction considering the larger context of the situation.

Those symptoms are stuffy nose, red-eye and itchiness, when ingested directly.  That happens to most people who smoke weed, anyway.  Almost to be expected.   They are almost identical to any other allergy (pollen, dust, etc)  Do we need to rid the outdoors of pollen in the spring now, too because people are allergic?  Where does the law/state's responsibility end and personal responsibility start?

Besides it sounds like he was polite and asked you if you could take it somewhere else, it's not like he threatened you or brought up calling the cops.  
Those symptoms aren't just hay fever, there's also the asthmatic symptoms and skin irritation.  
This isn't quite the parallel to pollen that you make it out to be. That's just a part of the environment and it occurs naturally, being subjected to marijuana is an entirely optional experience. The only way you would be subjected to it is if someone chooses to bring it around. If you have terrible pollen allergies you move to an area where you wont be subjected to it, if you have an allergy to something like marijuana you shouldn't have to worry about being exposed to something in a place it shouldn't be.  
It all starts from personal responsibility, the reason this bill passed to block smoking in parks is because people weren't responsible. He didn't get the law involved like he very well could have, he asked you to smoke it elsewhere and you refused. He did it exactly the way you said it should be, and you refusing is why it gets made illegal, because even though what you're doing could cause health problems for someone else you don't care.",titanhermant,2015-02-19 12:16:39

Pickup trucks that aren't in 4hi or lo will get stuck extremely easily, because there is so little weight over the drive wheels.

Those are all an aspect of Portland, but it is certainly not representative, and it its completely in line with the image that has been built up over the past five to ten years. What would have challenged the stereotype would have been a dude in some clothes from target that was a little overweight going to olive garden, or an *unexceptional* businessman in a suit and tie going to work at his job at a government agency, or a woman in a dress with her hair all made up and no tattoos pushing her kid in a stroller as he eats a popsicle with HFCS bought from Safeway.

"&gt;I guess i take offense at saying ed edmo is eccentric and portlandia-ish. 

I can understand that. This is why I said *outliers* and eccentrics. I was meaning for him to be categorized as an outlier, in that Native Americans are obviously marginalized and represent a small percentage of the population. My intent was not to suggest he was an eccentric. 

&gt;but you're right that for the east-coast market that consumes the whole portlandia bs wholesale, a native wearing clothing that echoes the past is going to be completely foreign and just more evidence that portland is not normal. 

Exactly. I just feel the whole set of pictures will just reaffirms those sorts of stereotypes, and when mixed in with all the other superficial image intense archetypes portrayed in the pictures, Ed Edmo is reduced to what he represents to an audience (namely the ""token Native American"") rather than as a dynamic person that is more than just an image of an archetype.

2) Each ""chunk"" (time or 'event' based) is made immutable by protecting it with a hash matching both it and the previous ""scene"" and hash, so if someone tampers with it it'll be obvious.

3) Video gets treated as semi-public records, where if there's a ""good"" (nebulous term) reason that someone should get access to a clip, they can do so.  If law enforcement releases a clip, the related video automatically falls under public records to prevent the out-of-context concerns.

4) Camera functionality, audio pickup, and field of view is constantly monitored by the ""back end.""  If something goes wrong, officer / supervisor is immediately notified and they are off duty until it is resolved.  Tampering with the equipment is grounds for immediate termination, no union appeal, you're just gone.  Attempt law enforcement activities with it turned off, lose your qualified immunity.  This is the future; equipment does not malfunction as much as much as police in certain jurisdictions would have us believe.

Lot of hand-waviness and half-baked ideas, of course.  That's a lot of data being generated, so some sort of retention policies would need to come into play.  Maybe entire shift gets recorded and stored for a day or two.  ""Events"" get triggered (automatically) and get stored for a week.  If something gets flagged as ""of interest,"" the whole shift is stored indefinately.

Do you know how much that would cost to have hundreds of officers constantly streaming HD video + audio 24x7x365? For 100 cops we'd be talking ~200 Mbps = 2+ terabytes A DAY.

""Constantly streamed"" was probably the wrong choice of words.  ""Opportunistically streamed"" may be a better choice.  I was thinking that video would get buffered on the device (possibly offloaded to larger storage on the vehicle?) and then as they come in range of a higher bandwidth sink (wifi at the station or whatever) it gets uploaded to the data warehouse.  The main reason to offload it is to prevent tampering.

2TB a day is an insignificant amount of data.  YouTube, to go for the obvious example, [takes in over 100 hours of data every minute](https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html).  Not all of it is high-def, but using [their encoding estimates](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171),  the lower limit on that is 1064kbit/s (360p with mono audio).  If I'm doing my math right (1064 kilobits/second * (60 seconds/minute) * (1 byte/8 bits)  * (1 megabyte / 1024 kilobytes)), that works out to be 7.8 megabytes/minute of potato-quality video.  100 hours of footage at that rate is about 45 gigabytes, so per hour YouTube takes in a minimum for 2.7 TB.  Realistically, though, the data rates are going to vary wildly (especially since most cameras shoot a minimum of 720p), so this number is exceedingly low.  The point is that the amount of data to be stored is a problem to be solved, but not an impossible roadblock.

&gt; So you are going to send officers home when you are understaffed and there is an imminent / ongoing threat? Bullshit. If you're loved one is kidnapped you don't want one less able bodied, trained officer in pursuit because their camera lens is fogged up.

Just a sec, let me pull up my [logical fallacy bingo card](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/pdf/LogicalFallaciesInfographic_A3.pdf).  They aren't ""sent home,"" they're given another working camera or told ""your video or audio isn't working, fix it.""  Essentially the same procedure that they'd follow if any of the tools of their trade were malfunctioning.  Let's take your appeal to emotion and turn it into a more fleshed out, if absurd, hypothetical.  My loved ones sell something on Craigslist.  Sleeper-cell terrorists arrive, haggle over the pre-agreed upon price, and then take everyone hostage, resulting in a high speed freeway chase, all available officers requested to join the pursuit.  One officer is coming from a call in the Hijinks district, where unbeknowst to him, someone has jammed a banana up his Crown Vic's tailpipe, causing enough enough backpressure to blow the engine head clean off.  There is still an imminent / ongoing threat, but he's likely going to return to the station to obtain another vehicle rather than join the pursuit down I-5 on foot.  ""Able-bodied"" isn't just physical fitness and training; it implies that you have all the tools required to do your job.

&gt;The whole notion of ""nothing will ever happen without a cop recording it"" is not even remotely realistic, especially not for a widespread roll out of a complicated, multifaceted new technology. That would be a good goal to shoot for in 2025, not 2015.

Why not?  There's nothing fundamentally complicated or new about a body camera device.  Camera, microphone, processor, storage, radio, and power supply.  Same concept as a cell phone (and I'd be very surprised if the body cameras on the market don't derived from cellular phone designs).  An officer wearing a camera during their shift is the very definition of realistic:  [It's](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/nyregion/new-york-police-officers-to-begin-wearing-body-cameras-in-pilot-program.html) [happening](http://online.wsj.com/articles/what-happens-when-police-officers-wear-body-cameras-1408320244) [right](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/3/dc-police-to-test-costly-body-mounted-cameras-in-p/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&amp;utm_medium=RSS) [now](http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/09/06/body-cams-come-brevard/15194939/).

&gt; SMH. Just put your overwhelming cop-hate on pause for 30 seconds and think about why allowing immediate termination without any due process would be a bad idea. How about a racist supervisor doesn't like you because you're black so they issue a camera to you that is altered.

Strawman on a [slippery slope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJPm52rmKYI).  I didn't say there wouldn't be an investigation, I said that if you were found to have intentionally tampered with your recording equipment, it's a gross enough breach of conduct to warrant dismissal.

I do agree with half of your hypothetical;  Yes, if Sgt. Black (upon whom the ironic juxtaposition of his last name and views on racial purity are lost) alters a camera and issues it to Officer White (who happens to be of African descent),  taxpayers will lose a 20 year veteran.  I don't agree, however, that they'd replace the supervisor with a newly trained rookie.  Wouldn't they simply promote from within?  Officer White isn't the one who tampered with the equipment.  His (former) boss did, who probably had no business issuing equipment in the first place.

&gt; And many other situations where recording would be inappropriate.

Examples?  If you are performing policing activities, why wouldn't these be subject to later review?

&gt; Just put your overwhelming cop-hate on pause for 30 seconds

Where are you getting that I hate police officers from any of this discussion?  If you read through the articles I link above, municipalities that have rolled out body cameras have all shown a pretty significant drop in complaints against their officers.  This means that either there are less false claims by disgruntled citizens or fewer actions by ""less morally robust"" officers who are now on better behavior since they know they are being monitored.  Both of these are a good thing.",krampus503,2014-09-06 12:21:20
"&gt; 2TB a day is an insignificant amount of data.

I'm an engineer for a cell phone company. 2 TB a day is roughly equivalent to the amount of data we serve for the entire Oregon/SW Washington market. But, you're right, for the 3rd largest website IN THE ENTIRE WORLD it is practically nothing. I wonder how what YouTube's OPEX is compared to the budget of the City of Portland?

&gt;  There's nothing fundamentally complicated or new about a body camera device.

There is also nothing fundamentally complicated about payroll software yet Portland's[ $14 million, 14-month implementation of new SW ended up costing the city some $47 million and taking 30-months instead](http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/city-of-portland-financial-and-hrpayroll-project-overbudget-by-over-30-million). Then there was the Cover Oregon website, the water department billing software, and seemingly any other new large scale public sector technology roll out. 

&gt;  I didn't say there wouldn't be an investigation, I said that if you were found to have intentionally tampered with your recording equipment, it's a gross enough breach of conduct to warrant dismissal.

When a cop kills, coerces, or violate someone's civil rights they get union representation. I think everyone can get on board with purposeful tampering being grounds for termination because it is inherently dishonest, but neutering their ability to defend themselves against such serious allegations is just plain wrong. 

&gt;Examples? If you are performing policing activities, why wouldn't these be subject to later review? 

Meeting with a confidential informant, going into a locker room, making a personal phone call while on a break, eating lunch, meeting with another officer to bitch about your boss, meeting with a union rep, meeting with a supervisor for a performance review. Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head. 

&gt; Where are you getting that I hate police officers from any of this discussion?

The data needs to be streamed to prevent tampering from untrustworthy cops. The cops that are accused of tampering tried without representation. Loss of qualified immunity. ""equipment does not malfunction as much as much as police in certain jurisdictions would have us believe"" = police are liars. Not that all cops are honest and trustworthy but the vast majority are and putting in all these fail-safes would make the program much more complicated, susceptible to delays, considerably more expensive. If that is how the program exists elsewhere and they can just go to a vendor and say ""give me what Rialto, CA has"" then awesome. But the more change orders the more potential for disaster.

"As someone on reddit, I'm fully aware of the potential benefits of this, however, for departments that are against it, what are their reasons besides it costing money?",clive_bigsby,2014-09-05 13:02:11
"Couple of reasons:

Officer privacy.  Obviously we're not talking about traffic stops here, but cops do need to go to the bathroom every so often while on duty.  Even though they are working for the public, bathroom visits have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Same thing goes if the cop receives a phone call from a family member, say their wife telling them that their child was hurt at school, or there's been a death in the family, or something along those lines.

Victim privacy.  The victim of a violent attack, especially a rape victim, may really not want to recount their story in front of a camera, even one as innocuous as a chest cam.  They've already gone through an emotional hell, the staring eye of the camera would only make reliving it worse.  Many victims may not be willing to talk if a camera is present.

Confidential Informant privacy.  CIs aren't just used by detectives trying to bust open major murder conspiracies.  They are used by beat cops to keep track of street-level incidents, everything from pimps who are too abusing with their prostitutes to dealers who are selling to kids to violent crimes like drive bys and murders.  Them knowing there is a camera in place will make 99% of them walk away, regardless of whether or not the camera can or will be turned off or if the footage can only be viewed with a court order.

And yes, that doesn't touch the money issue, which won't be an insubstantial amount.

Now, are these reasons not to get cameras on officers?  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  But they are still very important questions that need good answers if cameras are to be an effective tool for the good of the public AND the good of a department.",Osiris32,2014-09-05 13:30:07

"You raise some really good points. Of course everything is done at the cost of something else, but the privacy of victims and effectiveness of CIs is really troubling. Officer privacy is as well although it seems like some sort of rules could be written for something like that - muting the feed during bathroom breaks would be easy and something could be worked out for private calls - although this does open doors for abuse.  

Anyway thanks for sharing the other side, the value of cameras is great for both police and civilian, but it's important to consider the balance.",pdxsean,2014-09-05 13:51:37
"I can actually come up with what sounds like a good solution for officer privacy, by having them call in to a supervisor and get permission to do a multi-step function that would allow the camera to be turned off but not be something that could happen ""accidentally.""  The officer would call in, explain the situation, a time would be marked off saying ""camera off - 13:50 for restroom break"" and then another mark would be made when the officer was done.  If a break went too long, or if there was a pattern of too many breaks, then the supervisor might be able to pull that officer in to see if they need medical attention, or retraining, or disciplinary action.

But I'm not a cop yet, so I can't say for certain how a policy like that would exactly be written.",Osiris32,2014-09-05 14:07:31

"Yes, absolutely, it is; that would be the idea. The act of switching the camera off would make any incident of potential misconduct that arises during that time guilty until proven innocent, giving the officers incentive to keep the camera rolling anytime there was a potential incident. If the camera is on (as it should be) the standard remains innocent until proven guilty as per normal.

It'll never happen, but maybe it should. Losing the footage/malfunctioning equipment 'happens' way too often when they beat the shit out of somebody, and that should absolutely count as a major strike against them if it does.",FOHWTBS,2014-09-06 09:22:11

Exactly how often does this actually happen?  The DOJ says there were about 16,000 complaints against law enforcement agencies last year, how many of those had situations where an officer's recording system was turned off/had a malfunction/lost the footage?

Wait, let's keep it local, since we're talking about Portland Police.  How many times has that happened here in Portland?  Or in the whole state of Oregon?

"I'd say CI work doesn't need to involve beat cops, especially considering afaik only Hawthorne has actual cops walking a beat. They can go through a plainclothes handler who then spreads information to actual patrol units.

"&gt; I'd say CI work doesn't need to involve beat cops, especially considering afaik only Hawthorne has actual cops walking a beat. They can go through a plainclothes handler who then spreads information to actual patrol units.

But that's the point, beat cops having CIs means they are out of their cruisers and talking to people more.  It's an aspect of community policing, and was something that the PPB was more adept at pre-Mark Kroeker.  It's also a faster way of disseminating information than having a middle man who not only has to get the info to responding officers but also has to work a wide array of people spread out over a larger area.

It doesn't help the victim and in many cases a uniform can cause them to shut up because ""suddenly it's too big of a deal to deal with""

That means either hiring a bunch more cops, or transferring a bunch of patrol officers into major crimes/investigations and making them detectives.  Beat cops are almost ubiquitously the first law enforcement that anyone ever deals with when they call 911.  Better training on how to deal with sexual assault victims or victims who are responding badly emotionally to a crime, now that I can get behind.

&gt; Officer privacy: No reason they can't have it turned off to go to the bathroom. 

Except that almost everyone who is pushing for these cameras doesn't want the officer to have that ability at all, due to the possible abuse it provides.

&gt; Though I tend towards saying 'if you get to carry a gun and have the abilities of an officer, your price is a bit less privacy since you can destroy someone's life figuratively and literally so deal with it"".

A)  They already do, there are numerous things in the private life of an officer that can get them disciplined or even fired that wouldn't get a second glance in the private sector.  Infidelity, financial problems, hell even just who you are legitimately dating can be cause to get hauled in with an IA investigator.  And B) setting up police to be second class citizens is NOT going to help fix the trust that has been lost between the police and the community, and in fact is only going to further foster resentment in the law enforcement community towards the public.",Osiris32,2014-09-05 14:02:31

Video retention and public access to the data:  

There are privacy concerns for the officers (they have to potty _sometime_, for instance) and actual concerns for things like victim privacy, informant privacy, etc.  

An excellent solution would be to allow the officer to self-censor the video, perhaps by some button pressing mechanism or at the end of their shift, or at some regular interval (weekly/monthly) review where parts of the video the officer deems ""private"" are censored from public view, subject to review if there's _any_ question.  The data is note deleted, but omitted from release.  At no point should any reason allow censored data to be unreviewable.

The case where officers were intentionally [disabling their patrol car recording equipment](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/apr/07/local/la-me-lapd-tamper-20140408) in LA demands that the issue be addressed before it becomes an issue.

"thanks! You can see the caves from McNeil Point and that's about 2/3rds the way there. The conditions can change what you would actually need to get to the caves. It can go from a long summertime day hike with no special gear to winter alpine climbing gear. There are a good amount of write ups online that give more detailed trip reports.

"I don't even say ""actress"" instead of ""actor"", you can damn well bet that I'm not spelling a word differently because of gender. Genderizing nouns is pointless IMO. At least we don't have different variants of ""the"" for different object genders...

EDIT: I figure I'll clarify, I don't hate genderizing nouns because of any sort of feminist agenda or anything, I dislike it because it adds a layer of complexity to the language that doesn't actually add anything. There are enough stupid grammatical rules in english anyway. Many of them are obsolete.

While Portland definitely does better than many, various organizations (including mine) struggle to keep our programs going.

I've coined a little term called ""the invisible poor"": poverty and homelessness are not comfortable topics for folks to discuss--and we tune it out a bit. We're awash in ads and marketing about how to look, be, and think. We're busy with our own lives. Actually seeing homeless and mentally-ill people make us uncomfortable. These are all things I struggle against as I try to raise money for the charity I serve.

"Here's a PNW pro tip: Buy RainX. I know it seems like some gimmick product (or at least that's what I thought at first) but holy shit it's amazing. Rain just beads up and flies right off the windshield. It's like $5 for a bottle or whatever but it's so worth it. I'm still on my first bottle and it lasted me through last winter.

They also have RainX wiper fluid but I haven't tried that yet, either as a supplement to a normal RainX application or as a standalone solution. Also wiper blades but that I'm much more skeptical of.

EDIT: Last time I was in a rain-related reddit thread, someone suggested an even longer-lasting hydrophobic windshield solution but I can't remember what it's called. Might be applied only by windshield shops? Anyone have any ideas?",ricodued,2013-09-28 21:30:16

May not be quite as good as the solution by itself, but its only slightly more expensive than regular wiper fluid with significant additional benefits, so worth it in my opinion. I don't use the stand-alone solution and water still easily beads and flies off as if it were the regular stuff.

Also have the latitude blade currently on my car. Good buy, though honestly I've also used Michelin  brand wipers with a similar beam construction (as opposed to several pressure points on a typical blade) and the difference is minute.

"I'm from an area of the country that regularly receives around 150 inches of snowfall per year and while I would consider myself an expert at driving in snow and other harsh conditions at this point, the difference between dry, wet, and slightly snowy roads can be significant in terms of traction. If anything, slight snow can be more dangerous than 6"" packed down over the course of several months as it's far less visible at times.

The fact is that drivers native to the area aren't used to those rare conditions that we experience like one day per year. So when it rolls around they panic and then it's over. There's no six-month-long continuous snowfall where you have a few days or even weeks to get used to it.

It's easy to manage *if you have the experience*. The PNW doesn't really offer  the experience to learn snow driving because it lasts for like, a day.

"The contaminant in the water is **e. coli**


What you do

* Boil any water for 60 seconds before consumption (drinking, teeth brushing, washing foods)

* Obviously bottled water is safe

* Showering is fine as long as you don't drink the water

* If you wash your hands/shower let them dry completely and apply hand sanitizer before you touch things that go in your mouth

* Wash dishes as normal, but rinse with **Boiling water**

* Throw away your ice (and only make new ice with boiled/bottled water)

* **BRITA FILTERS DON'T KILL E. COLI** and you should throw away any filters you've already used once the water is safe


This will take a few days to clear up. They have to figure out what the problem is, fix it, clear out the system and get clean negative test results. 
Boil some big pots of water, put it in your fridge.  Please avoid calling 9-1-1 right now, people are probably already panicking and overloading the system with questions, if you need more info follow the PWB website. 

As for the contamination itself, the risk is low, but may have been present since the 20th of May. If you notice any severe stomach cramping, watery or bloody diarrhea, don't hesitate to go to a doctor or hospital if you feel sick.

"**Since the PWB site is currently down (RDOS) here's the impacted areas:**

All Portland Water Bureau customers are affected. Also affected are customers of the following water providers:

• Burlington Water District

• City of Gresham (North of I-84)

• Lake Grove Water District

• Lorna Portland Water

• Palatine Hill Water District

• Rockwood Water District

• Tigard Water Service Area (including Durham, King City and Bull Mountain)

• Valley View Water District

• West Slope Water District

**Since the tolerance for indicators such as E. Coli and Fecal Coliforms is ZERO, any trace amount found (no matter how minute) requires issuing a boil water notice**. This doesn't mean that a person shouldn't heed the warning, rather, that an extremely minute amount (possibly completely tolerable for a healthy person) can trigger the same level warning as a full on sewer contamination of the drinking water.

If you are not feeling well in a day or so, here's some info from the [NIH](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000296.htm):

**Causes**

E. coli is a type of bacteria that lives in the intestines of humans and animals. **Most of the time, it does not cause any problems.** (NOTE- emphasis mine) However, certain types (or strains) of E. coli can cause food poisoning. One strain (E. coli O157:H7) can cause a severe case of food poisoning.


**Treatment**

Most of the time, you will recover from the most common types of E. coli infection within a couple of days. The goal of treatment is to make you feel better and avoid dehydration. Getting enough fluids and learning what to eat will help keep you or your child comfortable.

You may need to:

* Manage the diarrhea
* Control nausea and vomiting
* Get plenty of rest 

You can drink oral rehydration mixtures to replace fluids and minerals lost through vomiting and diarrhea. Oral rehydration powder can be purchased from a pharmacy. Be sure to mix the powder in safe water.

**You can make your own rehydration mixture by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of baking soda and 4 tablespoons of sugar in 4 ¼ cups (1 liter) of water. (be certain the water source is pure/not contaminated)** 

You may need to get fluids through a vein (IV) if you have diarrhea or vomiting and cannot drink or keep enough fluids in your body. You will need to go to your health care provider's office or the emergency room. 

If you take diuretics (water pills), talk to your health care provider. You may need to stop taking the diuretic while you have diarrhea. Never stop or change medicines without first talking to your health care provider. You can buy medicines at the drugstore that can help stop or slow diarrhea. Do not use these medicines without talking to your health care provider if you have bloody diarrhea or a fever. Do not give these medicines to children. 

**Outlook (Prognosis)**

**Most people will get better in a few days, without treatment.** Some uncommon types of E. coli can cause severe anemia or kidney failure. 

When to Contact a Medical Professional

Call for an appointment with your health care provider if:

* You are unable to keep down fluids.
* Your diarrhea does not get better in 5 days (2 days for an infant or child), or it gets worse.
* Your child has been vomiting for more than 12 hours (in a newborn under 3 months, call as soon as vomiting or diarrhea begins).
* You have abdominal pain that does not go away after a bowel movement.
* You have a fever above 101°F, or your child has a fever above 100.4°F with diarrhea.
* You have recently traveled to a foreign country and developed diarrhea.
* You see blood or pus in your stool.
* You develop symptoms of dehydration, such as not peeing (or dry diapers in a baby), thirst, dizziness, or light-headedness.
* You develop new symptoms. 


[**Some info on the EPA's requirements for acceptable levels of Pathogens and Indicators in drinking water**:](http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/pathogens.cfm)

**What are indicators?**
Indicators are physical, chemical, or other parameters whose presence at a level outside of specified limits may reflect a problem in the treatment process or in the integrity of the distribution system.


Indicator | Description | 
 :--------|:--------:
Total coliforms| Coliforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the environment and used as an indicator that other, potentially harmful, bacteria may be present. Coliforms found in more samples than allowed is a warning of potential problems. |
Fecal coliform and Escherichia coli (E. coli) | Fecal coliform and E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that water may be contaminanted by human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause short term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms.  They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, and people with severely compromised immune systems.  | 
 

**Treatment Techniques and MCLs Pertaining to Indicators**

Indicator | MCLG | Treatment Techniques and MCLs and Regulation(s)
 :--------|:--------:|---------:
Total coliforms | Zero | Total Coliform Rule requirements: Systems are required to take samples for total coliforms based on the population served, source type and vulnerability to contamination. No more than 5.0 percent of samples for total coliforms can be positive in one month. (For systems that collect fewer than 40 routine samples per month, no more than one sample can be total coliform-positive per month). If a sample tests positive for total coliforms, the system must collect a set of repeat samples within 24 hours, and also analyze for fecal coliform or E. coli. | Fecal coliforms and E. coli | Zero | Total Coliform Rule requirements: A routine sample that tests positive for fecal coliform or E. coli triggers repeat samples. If  any repeat sample tests positive for total coliform, the system has an acute MCL violation. A routine sample that tests positive for total coliform but tests negative for fecal coliform or E. coli triggers repeat samples. If any repeat sample then tests positive for fecal coliform or E. coli, the system has an acute MCL violation. |

Restaurants don't have the extra space to boil up large amounts of water, nor the time to wait for it to cool it so they can use it in people ice water. And then making ice? Ice machines are hooked directly up to the water supply, so no one gets ice. This could be a problem for things that require it, like seafood. 

Hospitals need sanitary conditions as much as possible, and if there's an ecoli outbreak in the water supply, people with weak immune systems can die.

wat. No one has gotten sick from the water as of yet and and it's unlikely they will. E. coli are natural bacteria that live in the stomachs of most mammals.

I know what you're saying, but just because you haven't been affected yet doesn't mean you're safe from contracting it. It only takes a few E.coli to cause a problem in the human body (in comparison it takes millions of salmonella to make you sick). 

Chances are there won't be a single person affected by this problem, but if you've had any kind of food-poisoning or similar issues in the past you wouldn't want to take the risk.

""Can I drink coffee made with untreated water?

During a boil water order, you can use your coffeemaker if it heats water to 70 °C or hotter. Most germs are killed at this temperature. Test the coffee temperature with a thermometer. Let the coffee sit in the pot for at least 5 minutes before you drink it. If your coffee maker does not heat the water to at least 70 °C, use bottled or boiled water to make coffee.""

(70 degrees C = 158 degrees F)

"No, I think the intent is to reduce incidences of all microorganisms generally:

&gt;What are the requirements of the rule?

&gt;Systems initially monitor their water sources to determine treatment requirements. This monitoring involves two years of monthly sampling for Cryptosporidium. To reduce monitoring costs, small filtered water systems will first monitor for E. coli–a bacterium that is less expensive to analyze than Cryptosporidium–and will be monitor for Cryptosporidium only if their E. coli results exceed specified concentration levels.

&gt;Treatment: Filtered water systems will be classified in one of four treatment categories (bins) based on their monitoring results. Most systems are expected to be classified in the lowest bin and will face no additional requirements. Systems classified in higher bins must provide additional water treatment to further reduce Cryptosporidium levels by 90 to 99.7 percent (1.0 to 2.5-log), depending on the bin. Systems will select from different treatment and management options in a “microbial toolbox” to meet their additional treatment requirements. All unfiltered water systems must provide at least 99 or 99.9 percent (2 or 3-log) inactivation of Cryptosporidium, depending on the results of their monitoring.

&gt;Uncovered Finished Water Reservoirs: Systems that store treated water in open reservoirs must either cover the reservoir or treat the reservoir discharge to inactivate 4-log virus, 3-log Giardia lamblia, and 2-log Cryptosporidium. These requirements are necessary to protect against the contamination of water that occurs in open reservoirs....

http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/lt2/basicinformation.cfm

It seems PWB was actually issued a variance by the State to not have to deal with Cryptospridium since it wasn't a big concern - that specifically would've been addressed by a UV treatment plant.

&gt;

&gt;__Odin__ (/ˈoʊdɨn/; from [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse) *Óðinn*, ""*The Furious One*"") is a major [god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir) in most if not all branches of [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples) mythology especially in the [Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology) branch of [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples) mythology, the __[Allfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_gods)__ of the [gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_gods), and the ruler of [Asgard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgard).  Homologous with the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language) ""[Wōden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%8Dden)"", the [Old Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Saxon_language) ""Wôdan"" and the [Old High German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German) ""Wôtan"",  the name is descended from [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic) ""__*[Wōdanaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%8Ddanaz)__"" or ""__*Wōđanaz__"".

&gt;""Odin"" is generally accepted as the modern English form of the name, although, in some cases, older forms may be used or preferred. His name is related to *[ōðr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93%C3%B0r)*, meaning ""fury, excitation"", besides ""mind"" or ""poetry"". His role, like that of many of the Norse gods, is complex. Odin is a principal member of the [Æsir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir) (the major group of the [Norse pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_pantheon)) and is associated with [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War), battle, victory and death, but also [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom), [Shamanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism), [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal\)), [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry), [prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy), and the hunt. Odin has [many sons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Odin), the most famous of whom is the thunder god [Thor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor).

"&gt; People now don't take driving seriously.

Based on? Anecdotal evidence? Statistically people are better drivers than ever. In fact the number of driving fatalities in 2009 was 377, where it was 579 in 1990^[1](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/transportation/motor_vehicle_accidents_and_fatalities.html), and if you take into account population and look at fatality rate per miles driven, the number has been cut in half in that time frame. Then if you look at causation, you'll find that 30% of all traffic fatalities are caused by drivers with a BAC over the legal limit.

At some point you're going to start seeing diminishing returns on the resources you put in to trying to stop these things, and at some point you have to accept that you're not going to get the numbers down to zero. This is similar to what we've seen with the war on drugs where they keep pumping money into that system and the results aren't linear (i.e. you can't keep cutting crime rates by 8% every single year, it will have a threshold).

I have no evidence to show that forcing headlights to be on would affect anything in either direction as I don't think there have been any studies as such, so maybe rather than legislation, a (non tax payer funded) study would be a better place to start.

BTW, I always drive with my lights on, that's what they taught us in driver's ed and it just became habit. In my Subaru I just leave the lights on and the ambient light sensor controls them for me, but I like having the ability to switch it on and off for various things; sitting at a curb waiting for someone, don't need headlights, using the car as a generator, don't need headlights, trying to get someone's attention, off-on works better than a flash of brights.",fuzzyfuzz,2013-11-19 15:30:03

They have repeatedly proven to be feckless cronies who can't think past their damn zippers. Something like this that will not have some pol's name on it to boost their little egos will only make progress if there is graft. Look to the parking meter-gate as an example.

"**Attention: To those asking about what can be done with smaller suburban governments.**

I would also highly suggest contacting the **county commission** as well. Even if you live in a city, you still have a representative on the county board. Specifically, Washington County. Local governments in the county are geographically fractured and there are large swaths of land between the City of Portland and the City of Beaverton which are not incorporated into any municipality. The county is also the administrative level which handles a lot of infrastructure and zoning crap. 

It is highly likely that these areas need to play ball with Google to make fiber for the region a possibility (they connect the ""silicon forest"" [don't shoot the messenger] to the state's largest city, they're chock full of technology workers, and they are generally wealthy areas which tend to pay for these things) so hell, send them an email even if you aren't a direct constituent.

1. its overhead to set it up

I don't think most people realize what a huge project installing literally 100's of miles of fiber optic cable is going to be, streets will be tore up traffic diverted, and hundreds of thousands of people inconvenienced...Google is looking for a market in which the public and the local government do everything in their power to ""smooth"" the path for Google...and THAT is not how Portland works...everyone screams ""we want fiber!!!"" right until that means work crews tear up your neighborhood cut down trees and disrupt their daily routines....the end result is going to be endless ""community meetings"", ""public input sessions"", and city commissioners exerting what ever power they have to delay,  hassle, sue and red tape google right into oblivion...

As with the the pick of Provo Utah previously, I suggest they'll pick another smaller market with a conservative government, who's more willing to tell the ceaseless whiners in the public to STFU, and blast away the bureaucratic red tape Portlanders consider essential

That subsidy has rapidly decreased to the point where students are now paying a much larger portion of that cost.  

I don't work for the University of Washington and I know we're talking about PSU here, but [UW published a great handout of how this works and what it looks like at their institution](http://www.washington.edu/externalaffairs/files/2012/10/tuition.pdf).

Yes it's status quo, everyone thinks it sucks, I disagree that it has to be this way or that it can't change.

Like I said, I just don't see how they can't just hire some other well-connected bureaucrat and save a few bucks. People confuse price with quality all the time, there's nothing different about this situation. 

It seems like there is arms race to pay administrators more, all the while education declines and there's no measurable difference between one administrator than another. For example, when we got Janet Napolitano nothing change. So how can you justify her costs? Literally nothing changed... It just seems absurd.

It forces the administration to squander cash, while the poop ultimately ends up in the hands of the students. 

If we reformed the way higher education was handled, it wouldn't be this way. Very few universities operate differently here in the states and it needs to change.

"&gt;It's slowly been dwindling year, by year-- down from something like 25% in the early 2000s, down to less than 11% this year. 

Couldn't that also be due to hiring more and more administrators, thus costing more and more. That would push the reimbursement rate down. If you're hiring more and more admin on the same budget, this is of course going to happen. The question is why are they hiring administrators faster than full-time faculty?

&gt;If we reformed the way higher education was handled

Education flat out sucks at every level in America. K-12 is being ruined by standardized tests and NCLB. Meanwhile they're intent on doing the same thing to higher learning. ",witchsbrew,2014-02-27 16:02:06
"I agree with your second point, absolutely.

There are separate pools that pay for administration and which regulate tuition. We could not pay administration-- but a grand majority of that administration is in development, which is actively securing funds for scholarships, infrastructure and non-salary paying causes. 

Those causes might not literally cut tuition, but they definitely help students secure funding and find access to education.

What we should be picketing (and this was made clearer to me by a professor I had a conversation with a bit ago), is state funding. Rather than giving out student loans that raise thousands of dollars a year, why not send that directly to the state schools in order to cut down tuition? Why are we loaning kids money as a means of supporting a state school, rather than just giving it to the university with the understanding that tuition would be lowered?",Coaste12ama,2014-02-27 16:10:07

"It's this:

If the President makes $100k one year, and gets a raise to $200k the next, that's a **100%** increase in salary.

Total additional cost to the school: **$100k more per year**.

If 100 professors get a raise from $100k to $110k, that is a **10%** increase in salary **each** for a total cost of **$1,000,000** to the school, per year.

So in other words, a 100% increase for a single person is 1/10th the cost of a 10% increase to a bunch of people.

And that is why the phrase, ""Lies, Damn Lies &amp; Statistics"" was invented.",pinkygonzales,2014-02-27 11:12:33

"I find these graphs misleading.  The relative outlay of money for a handful of administrators vs. a much much larger number of professors is vastly different.  The difference in pay between what the admin SHOULD be making (at least according to those against their pay) and what the ARE making, would likely only make a 1-2% increase (or less) in the professor's pay.  Unless the larger funding pool is increased, even if the administrators got no pay increases, it isn't going to be enough to cover any substantial raise for the professors.    
I see this same thing in school districts.  Teachers focusing on superintendent pay scales and using that to demand more money for teachers.  But the truth of the matter is a superintendent salary is a drop in the budget bucket for a district, while even small changes to teacher salaries have a *huge* effect on budgets simply because of their vastly higher employee numbers.    
Too often the admins are painted as the ""bad guys"" when it should be the overall funding sources that leave so little to be distributed to run a university or school system.   It's a misdirected complaint. ",3MXanthene,2014-02-27 16:08:10

You would think professors would understand that the chart is off on scale.

I have a staff of 100 (Not really, but let's say I do). I pay each of them $10. I make $100 for the same time period. Does my staff really make 10 times less then I do? Yes and No.

Individually, yes. They do. As a group, they get paid $1,000 and my group gets paid $100. So as a group, they are paid more then me.

"Thanks! This event was a weird confluence of two different groups working to pick up trash in Rocky Butte on the same day:

* Random local community folks organized through Facebook 
* The Grotto 

Both groups showed up on Saturday morning and were pleasantly surprised to see others in there pulling crap out!

I run through this area a few times a week and watched it deteriorate terribly this year. When it was obvious no organization was going to step up to do anything, I finally just said fuck it and put up a Facebook event and annoyed people in the local area.

Here's some info from a follow up post about the event:

&gt; The Rocky Butte park area sits at the hot-potato intersection of a least four separate, non-collaborating service organizations: The Grotto, City Bible Church, the Oregon Department of Transportation, and Oregon State Parks.
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zj4PGlPqH1F8.kM9m_BBazTrk

The entrance to City Bible Church sits literally across the street from the largest in-city pile of trash I've ever seen and they did nothing about it for over three months. ODOT owns a certain distance into the woods for the length of I-205 and they're mostly unaware of the Cormac McCarthy novel taking place on their land. I'm told Oregon State Parks has some control over ... something in there.

Unlike some other CA cities where the street homeless are either mentally ill, or destitute immigrants (like the central valley), Santa Cruz had a lot of otherwise healthy heroin addicts who live in camps in the forest. After it rained, I came across a couple bundles of needles held together with rubber bands, and at first my thought was that there had been a dumping of medical waste, but then I realized the river had come up and washed away neatly bundled supplies or trash that a homeless person had been keeping there.

My response was the same. Nick Fish had a person who works for *housing* to respond my inquiry about homelessness. My general retort was needles and debris have nothing to do with homelessness and it's an unsafe condition and not acceptable for parks.

There was a lot of uproar at the Seven Corners store last year over some Israel/Palestine stuff and I think that's when these New Seasons sign initially went up (at least it's when I first started noticing them).

The goal of these people with political signs in front of the store is clearly to antagonize, not to educate. They know people leaving just want to shop but they're hoping they can antagonize people into a conversation (heated, which happened at Seven Corners).

Another point.

Yes, it was nice for us, but he did it specifically so that his employee morale was up and so the people who applied and got hired were competent and didn't HR-related problems.  So a nice thing was done for business reasons, and it was still a nice thing.

"The smartphone tracking thing was pretty overblown.

It seems to me that people were shocked because they thought ""OMG Nordstrom hacked my phone"", when the reality is that nordstrom simply used RF triangulation in stores to know what foot traffic patterns were being used in store (which could help them optimize layout and marketing tactics). 

Everyone with a phone's wifi powered on is walking around broadcasting their every move (anyone with at least 3 antennas and some simple software can track people walking around) to the world.

They were tracking movement of people through the store, yes, but that same thing could be done with surveilance cameras-what was novel was that they used their in store wifi (which, did *not* connect to the customer devices) to accurately triangulate and track movements within the store.

It is both scary to me (I like my privacy) and awesome to me (I'm a systems engineer and novel uses of tech interest me). 

In the end, they didn't do anything that couldn't be achieved by assigning someone to sit and watch people do the same thing via the store cameras.

On the surface, yea it can sound scary to anyone who doesn't understand the technology they used to do the tracking, but from an educated perspective the in store tracking didn't alarm me.

I can actually think of a lot of utility to stores being able to use my location--

When I shop at Home Depot (a huge store), it would be awesome if I could use my smartphone to locate the item I want instead of having to roam around or ask someone to locate it for me. 

Location based services are very common with apps/smartphones now, so I wouldn't be surprised if the initial tracking Nordstrom did will eventually evolve into a shopping app that helps you locate items in your size (presently, Nordstrom pays employees to do just that-I'd imagine there is a potential cost savings to having an app find a dress on the rack in a certain size, or that is able to guide me to the rack that has my size slacks, so I save time).

"Yeah, what possible freedom do people think they are losing in this case? You're in a store. Public. With cameras. How is them keeping track of where you browse anything of importance? I too see the benefits of it to both stores and consumers.

You actually can now. The HD app was useless previously, but has been updated recently. Just search for what you want to find and it will tell you the exact aisle and bin/section it is located.

"I doubt you had much to do with the program ending here in PDX (they also ran the program in Seattle) since it was a marketing research program to begin with (the actual data collection was subcontracted out) and was largely a feasibility study.

Just for fun, I looked up a little bit of news articles related to it--and had to stop reading because the people interviewed (who clearly didn't understand how the tracking worked) by the news, and the news reporting (by people who seem to not understand how the tracking worked) was too terrible to read.

Stores generally rely on their cameras for this kind of floor traffic study (I've done IT work on a similar project), which takes a lot of man hours, or some expensive surveilance software and man hours.

The method Nordstrom used is actually LESS intrusive than the camera based methods typically used, because it simply tracks phone movement without care for personal info (or recording an image of the person being tracked). It is very useful for designing merchandising layouts.",epicrepairtime,2013-11-26 13:06:35

"Wifi is trackable, but your MAC address isn't ""personally identifiable"" (to the extent that using it to ID you requires either following you home or getting your carrier to sell your MAC and real name).

Your phone may broadcast where it has been, but if a service is just plotting MAC addresses then you aren't being identified.

If you are transmitting data (in the clear), then you are giving anyone who cares to listen in to your conversation whatever info you're sending (this is always the case and why bars and coffee shop wifi should not be trusted) and you should be useing SSL(TSL) connections at a minimum if you're worried (or VPN).

To track the movements of someone with wifi enabled it isn't necessary to collect any metadata (and depending on the device, there may not be much beyond just the MAC of the device to collect, which doesn't tell anyone who you actually are-it can only be used to know what you're connected to) or even the MAC address-it can all be done with directional antennas and just rely on signal strength (unknown if this is how the company Nordstrom hired did it this way or not).

The store already has your identifying info, if you use a credit card or bank card at POS, and tracks your movement through the store using surveilance already-so nothing new as a practice was taking place, the company was just using a system that gave them point data instead of relying on video tracking for the same data.

All of us are walking around broadcasting a signal that can simply be traced by reading signal power (no names or other metadata needed-just the signal strength gives all the data needed). Trust them or not, in order to track a person, there is no need to collect personal info during the tracking, because you provide the personal info at time of sale (and they know you're at the POS kiosk because they have the coordinates). It is a much more efficient program (read: costs far less to implement) to skip collecting anything other than point data during the tracking, because a cell phone SSID is typically not personally identifiable.

Again, this method of market research isn't new-the tech method (using the signal from phones) is what is new. 

Prior to this, the standard was to use camera based surveilance (which, by the way is tied into the POS machines so that when your card is ran there is a time stamp that places your real info with your traffic patterns).

That method worked very well, but required actually watching a person meander around the store (didn't just generate point data-so plotting movement required a lot of work converting the video to point data).

The method of simply recording that an electronic signal existed, and plotting the coordinate data onto a floor map, streamlines the process greatly.

It is good to be skeptical, but the only way to avoid being tracked is to pay cash at the store (even then, they still routinely use surveilance to plot floor habits) and pull the battery from your phone.

"I know that my results are anectdotal, but the clothing I've bought from Nordstrom has outlasted (by a factor of many years for a lot of the items) the clothing I've bought elsewhere.

I shop their sales (and shop at Nordstrom Rack as well) and often times find clothing that, while still isn't cheap (as places like Target) up front, if I factor the cost over the long term I get to use it (and how nice/comfortable a lot of the fabrics and cuts there are) I come out ahead cost wise.

I've gotten Polo shirts from Nordstrom for $50 on sale that have lasted me 8 years (and counting) now, without getting thread bare or faded (they are kind of grey blue, so that probably has something to do with the color ageing well), and have button downs that are on pace for the same lifespan. I wash them on gentle, but other than that I'm not babying them.

In contrast, I've had numerous shirts from places like Macys that are threadbare in 1-2 years on average, and might be $25-30 on sale. 

I'm starting to get to the point where if I am buying a new item that I just save up for the nicer item, since I've been finding that I get so much more use out of it and save money in the long term.",epicrepairtime,2013-11-26 10:04:31

"Yeah I think the best deterant is having a good lock and a well lit area. But I think that if there is a place everyone registered their bike and everyone looked to check serial numbers it would increase the use of that site or standardized API is fine, but if there is a standard API eventually someone will make a site that brings all the other sites together into one place. I like the stickers because it gives the person wanting to run the numbers a place where the bike was registered. There are plenty of ways a thief could do away with that though...

I actually think the best thing would be if bike sellers were responsible for registering all bikes sold and attaching a customer's name to a serial number in a database, there are so many people that walk into a shop, buy a bike, leave it somewhere, get it stolen and have no idea what to do. Every person who doesnt register their bike limits the effectiveness of registering a bike for everyone else. First of all because a thief knows that a bike is most likely to be untraceable, but also because when people go to buy a bike that might be stolen they think what's the use? There is nowhere reliable for me to run these serial numbers, I could try a few sites but chances are I'll miss some obscure registry that this person signed up on.

"I'm going to make a detailed post about everything when the video is done. Here's what I learned, though.

Most important: Assume that your bike WILL be stolen. It's really just a matter of time, and this attitude can help you delay the inevitable. ""An ounce of prevention..."" Try not to lock it up publically (Not always possible, I know). Always use a U-Bolt lock. These are not infallible. I was using one. Kryptonite locks will even warranty against bike theft. Look into your home/renters insurance and check for coverage of bicycle theft.... 

1. Keep the receipt, bill-of-sale (get one), and serial number of your bike on file. Never lose this.
2. Take pictures of your bike's parts, and keep these. Keep receipts for new parts.
3. Call non-emergency police at 503-823-3333 (for Portland) ASAP. File a police report. give them the Serial number. If you don't do this, then its just he-said/she-said, and you will not get your bike back (through the police)
4. Pawn-shops and bike stores are required by law to hold the bike for 30days before selling it. They are also required to check with police on the S/N before selling a bike
5. Check craigslist daily. Check for the bike's parts, too (remember those pics you took?)
6. Check other city's craigslists, too. Mine was in Seattle, and I only got it back because I checked that.
7. Police don't care about bike theft (just my opinion). Mine was $2500, which is a felony. It literally took them 45 minutes to show up to a felony crime, and they only showed up AFTER I had confronted the guy. It's a small problem compared to other stuff they deal with....
8. If you're lucky and locate your bike, you have two choices: call police and hope they set up a sting -OR- Do it yourself, and call 911 when you get there. I  did the latter because the officer on the non-emergency line said that ""The police may not show up if they get another more-important call."" (direct quote)... 
9. As far as setting up the sting, do it at a public place. NOT their house. A busy parking lot is very good. Do anything you can not to sound frantic. Don't email too much. Don't call too much. Lie your ass off - Your bike depends on it! Let them think you know nothing about bikes so that they under-estimate you.... you're just a casual buyer, not a victim.

10. As far as the sting goes: Call 911 before approaching them. Tell them anything you can to get them there fast. I didn't and the ones in my case had a really shitty sense of urgency. Bring a plural number of friends. Take video evidence. Be direct. Act tough. Look puffed up, and intimidating. Don't break the law, either... but do defend yourself and your property. Your safety is more important than the bike. The bike is more important then the arrest. The arrest is just revenge!

11. If the guy gets arrested, then press charges.

12. Remember that video you took? That is now evidence against the thief, and it's a great way to spread the word about this over-looked problem. Make an ass out of the guy in public. Humiliate them. I will soon put up a blog post with this guys address, phone numbers, fb page, mugshots, license plates. His girlfriend was actively involved, too. I am publishing all information about her as well... There are consequences for being a turd.

13. Finally, think about all of these things when you're buying a used bike. Thieves are tricky. Some are smart. Use your brain. Never buy bikes that you think may be stolen. 

EDIT: I think most seasoned cyclists will agree, but thieves take bike lights, seats, and wheels like no-body's business. Always take your lights off... Also, just pack a tool around, and get rid of anything that's quick-release (skewers).",wheeldonkey,2012-08-12 23:04:30

Also, likewise, I was able to track down my brother's bike when it got stolen from my parent's garage when I was 14. I figured the thief was some high school kid because a professional thief doesn't steal BMX bikes from people's garages. I got my parents to offer a 50 dollar reward for information and told everyone at school about it. The kid who stole the bike went to school in another district, but word got around enough that it didn't matter. I got a name and my parents went over to the thief's house one day. They immediately found the bike and called the cops who were completely uncooperative. The only way they were able to get the bike back was because it literally still had a sticker on it with my brother's name. The cops still gave my parents hell and told them not to meddle in police business anymore. I shit you not.",MrSparkle666,2012-08-13 01:29:41
"Yeah, speaking from experience, cops HATE dealing with anybody but bad drivers.  DETECTIVES love closing a case, but the rank and file popo is thinking ""This will take hours and hours, and it may turn out to be a mistake, and then all the time will be wasted.  I could have written 3 speeding tickets in this time!""

I've called the cops on one theft and one vandalism.  On the first one, I handed them a mountain of evidence on a silver platter, and it still took them over an hour to show up, and I never got a chance to press charges against the guy. (Do I have to call the station and request to press charges? If so, man, that's great for thieves!).   The other one, I was the only witness, and the culprit called me a liar.  So I understand letting the guy go, but the cop gave me a dirty look and said ""Why you gotta waste my time like this?""  As if it's my fault he wouldn't be able to prosecute!",,2012-08-14 21:41:18

Something with a little bit of rust and fenders, maybe an old basket on the front too.  Save your expensive bike for long rides where you won't have to lock it up in shady spots.

As much as I'd love to live in a world where a $2500 bike locked up with a $200 lock outside a bar won't get stolen, that's not the world we live in.  It's too easy to steal bikes, and when you can make a quick $1000 for that little amount of work, it's very attractive too.",wewon,2012-08-15 08:21:52

"   I think people do like vigilante justice. An indicator of that might be to look at many of the hollywood action films from the past 40 years. Also, it's often a ""feel good"" story when somebody gets mugged or assaulted in the street and breaks their attackers jaw to escape. I think the difference is that, like so many things, people like the IDEA of vigilante justice (like they like the IDEA of popular uprisings ect.) but have a very strict ""not in my backyard"" mentality. Where you can fetishize the action all day if it happens on the internet, or in a different part of the world, but as soon as it comes close enough to effect your little world, you are suddenly opposed to it.
    I agree bike theft is a problem. It fucking sucks. 
But I am thinking that most bike theives are poor and just looking to make a buck however they can. Believe me, law enforcement is already aware of poor people, they are their main target. If you were campaigning to have pigs do a better job of protecting your bike for you, they most effective realistic course of action would be to have more cops hanging around and doing more surveilance in areas where you might be cycling to and from.

"Not in my neighborhood then. 

There *is* a trailer in my 'hood that fits this description, but it has been here for as long as I have. 

I would tell the owner to make sure that their trailer wasn't towed for a parking violation (if the trailer was sitting for a while or lacked plates/valid registration it is possible it was towed). 

Usually, a trailer that is parked streetside should have wheels booted or chocked...I don't have time to look it up, but I seem to recall there being either a CoP rule or ORS about that. ",epicrepairtime,2014-12-26 15:44:25

"I don't know why you are being downvoted, regular studless snow tires do work better in almost every condition. Study from Washington State:  http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/research/reports/fullreports/551.1.pdf

""From the standpoint of
traction alone, studded tires, when new, often  provide some  benefit  over  other  tire  types on  ice-covered
roads when the temperature is near freezing. However, the advent of the new studless tires has diminished
the marginal benefit, and recent studies suggest that the infrequent, narrow range of conditions necessary
for  benefit  from  studded  tires  may not  outweigh their  detrimental effect on  traction in  dry or wet
conditions on  certain  pavement  types. In  addition, a  host of  primary and secondary safety factors are
related to studded tire use, many of which are very difficult to quantify, including facets of driver behavior
and safety perception.""",sumthingcool,2013-01-13 17:34:46
"So it's proven that the studded tires are wearing down our roads at ten times the rate of regular tires. People with studded tires should have to pay ten times the road tax when they fill up for gas. This would solve the problem immediately. Those people that really ~~need~~ want them can choose to keep using them and pay for all the extra damage they're doing. 

This way we won't have to outright ban them. Perhaps people will realize that it is time to move beyond this antiquated 1960s technology. Modern studless snow tires work better and don't damage the roads like studs.

If you get pulled over, you better have payed the tax and can show your certification, or you get a fine.

"We mostly use our truck with studded tires when we go up to the mountain, but sometimes when the other cars are taken use it to get to portland.  Here's a bit of devil's advocate: 

From the studies in your pdf...

&gt;In one set of stopping distance tests in Alaska, studded, studless, and allseason
tires performed nearly equally on snow, when averaged across several
vehicles. On ice, stopping distances for studded tires were 15 percent shorter
than for Blizzaks, which in turn were 8 percent shorter than for all-season
tires.

Every one of those tests was performed at 20-35 mph.  15 percent becomes pretty significant at the mountain with lots of traffic, and becomes an exponentially more significant as your speed increases, as is the case on the mountain.
  
&gt;A Norwegian study concluded that the use of studded tires tends to reduce the
accident rate by a small amount—from 1 to 10 percent.

...

&gt;The roughening of ice and pavement from studded tires provides a safety
benefit for all vehicles (with and without studs) by helping to prevent
formation of smooth, glare ice.

Bottom line is studded tires produce their best traction at or near the freezing mark.  Most people who travel up to the mountain will be driving in this condition.  They probably travel to the mountain regularly, and don't necessarily even *want* to be driving their studded tires around annoying all of you Portlanders.  Best way IMO to deal with this is to throw a tax on the purchase of the tires themselves, but it would also have to incorporate the positive externalities as listed above I assume, which would be tough.

"You wrote: ""You can make right turns from bike lanes.""

Saying ""from"" implies that your car is sitting in the bike lane waiting to turn right, you can't really do that. People do it all the time and I believe we should be allowed to, but it's technically against the law in Oregon and you will get a ticket for it. If you're at a red light to turn right, waiting for a gap in traffic or a green light, you have to be fully in your lane. Green box or not you can't be chilling in that spot.",miggitymikeb,2013-01-14 10:43:10
"The Oregon Rules of The Road provide that motorists may not use bicycle lanes except when necessary to cross over the lane.

ORS 811.440 provides as follows:

A person may operate a motor vehicle upon a bicycle lane when:
(a) Making a turn;
(b) Entering or leaving an alley, private road or driveway; or
(c) Required in the course of official duty.

"&gt;Part of being a ""speeder"" is looking at your speedometer an awful lot,

This may be a perfect example of ignoring logic.

By definition if you are looking at your speedometer you are taking your eyes off of the road.  
By definition taking your eyes off the road is a bad thing.  
I think we can all agree that when traveling faster you travel further than someone traveling the speed limit in the same amount of time.  
As such your statment above equals to.

&gt;While speeding I take my eyes off the of the road much more than those who are doing the speed limit.

This fact that your eyes will be off the road far longer than a person driving the speed limit, along with the fact that it takes you more time to stop in an emergency/have less time to react in an emergency, makes speeding not only illegal, but monumentally stupid and selfish.

&gt;And the other drivers are incredibly commonly going as slow as I describe.

Confirmation bias. We will have to agree to disagree.

This is a false equation. This is like saying the chances of there being two bombs on the plane is a billion to one so you always take a bomb on the plane to make your odds better.

&gt;If I asked a person if they wanted to be in the car ten or more hours fewer a year, who wouldn't say yes?

Of course they will say yes, but if you ask them that same question and then tell them that the risk for doing this includes major fines and a possible death which requires a mop to clean you up, they will probably think about it a little longer.

Interesting that now you are speeding on empty lanes when just mere seconds ago you were passing old ladies doing 30 in the 55.

If you have to do something which requires you to be some place at a specific time then you leave with enough time to do the speed limit, to do otherwise is foolish. You are trying to justify your illegal driving.

"&gt; rationale behind speeding

Speed limits are set by the government based on their idea of safety.  I disagree with them.  While certainly, on the twisty sections of I-84 between I-5 and I-205, a speed limit of 55 mph is reasonable.  But once you get east of I-205, the highway is pretty straight.  The limit here should be 75 mph, as far as I'm concerned.  US-26 west of OR-217 is pretty straight, too.  In times of light traffic, 75 mph would be pretty safe.

Hell, on long road trips, on long open stretches of interstate highway, my preferred speed is 90 mph.  When my trip is hundreds or thousands of miles, that extra speed makes a world of difference.",Sohcahtoa82,2013-01-14 09:35:59

"Several years ago I lost a lot of money - not to mention hundreds of hours - trying to make sales with my prints. So it's hard to consider risking thousands of dollars when I am still sitting on a hundred old prints in a storage closet. To be honest, I know that my quality has increased in the meantime and my work is probably more marketable, but I think the real issue is that the majority of people aren't interested in paying enough to make it profitable.

For instance, a shot like this one at 10""x20"" would cost me $60-70 for a mounted canvas print, which means I would have to sell it for $75-90 to make even a modest profit. If I was at Saturday Market, they have vendor fees so I'd have to price them more like $90-110 to make the same profit, depending on the quantity I move.  
  
Maybe I'm underestimating the market or am too much of a cynic but it just seems like a bad investment to me.",pdxsean,2015-01-26 13:51:35

"Chicago for starters, and in fact most of the Midwest. Really though if you want to see spastic weather go to a valley somewhere in the rocky mountains. One time in about 20 minutes of driving I had been through snow, bright blue sky, hail, and then thunderstorms.

For some reason people around here like to think that their weather is a big deal... which is fine for them, it does rain a lot, but I can't help but laugh at people who grew up around here who get all excited when they see lighting. Go to Florida, or again the Midwest. There you will see some mother fucking lightning.

The way the weather goes around here is that it's either raining, or it's not. That's it. Sometimes it's windy, and once in a dog's age it snows and then the god damn apocalypse happens. 1/4 inch of snow and people are abandoning their cars on the freeways.

I think part of the attraction of the area is the consistency of the weather, but who knows.",inflammable,2012-11-20 20:02:35
"Meh, I disagree.  I grew up in Minneapolis, then spent years in Chicago, Northern and Southern California, and then Portland.  Minneapolis and Chicago had spring storms come through, but for the most part it was pretty boring weather (with the exception of the thunderstorms).  California weather?  Pshaw, yeah, nothing there exciting at all.  

But Portland?  Sure, it's either raining or it's not.  But the sun-breaks you get in between rain squalls?  Simply amazing.  With the exception of the ""one-month-bleak"" we get (usually around January), almost every rain day has huge cloud-breaks as well.  

And what's always gets me about Portland weather is the lighting.  The lighting is always dramatic.  A photographers dream.  For some reason the lighting in Portland always feels special.  We noticed it when we arrived 9 years ago, and we remark on it to this day.",daroon,2012-11-20 20:43:56
Growing up in Minneapolis I'm surprised that you would side with the weather being more drastic here. I guess you guys are pretty far north but you're still on the edges of tornado alley. Tornado's are one of the most amazing things in weather IMHO. Not to mention that I'm pretty sure you guys have gotten a proper hail more than a couple times. I'm talking golf ball sized.

"You raise a good point: I truly miss and yearn for the days of startling awake to a huge thunderclap, and then spending the next half-hour watching the room light up then counting the seconds before the &lt;booOOom!&gt;.  Yes, that was awesome, and can not be found anywhere on the west coast.  

Regarding tornadoes, they are like earthquakes or hurricanes.  Sure, a region may be known for them, but in all reality how often do you get to experience one?  18 years in Minnesota, and I only witnessed, or was peripherally involved in, 4 or 5 of them at most.

From the perspective of day-to-day (even hour-to-hour) fluctuations, I still think Portland really offers an exciting variety of weather.  My experience is that the weather here keeps me more interested, more curious, and more involved than the other places I have lived.",daroon,2012-11-20 21:06:46

"The trailhead is close to Bonneville Hot springs.  Table mountain is what caused the constriction of the Columbia River at Bridge of the Gods.  There used to be a natural land bridge there a long time ago.  It's a little weird starting from here.  You essentially follow the road up for a while. and then go to a powerline tower and then a trail starts there.  Then you follow that to another road which takes you to the PCT.  If you miss the PCT it takes you up to Cave falls. follow the PCT to the left and after a while take a right straight up the hill and you'll be on your way to the top.  Lots hiking on rocky terrain next to cliff faces.

"Garfield Peak starts at the Crater Lake Lodge, and its about 3.5 miles round trip, about 1000ft elevation gain, and moderate difficulty (rocky).

Mt Scott starts from the East Rim road, and its about 5 miles round trip, about 1300ft elevation gain, and also moderate difficulty. First part is easy, then gets steeper, with an easier bit at the end. Ground is more sandy so its easier on your feet.

Both hikes have amazing views and I highly recommend them.",elislider,2013-07-15 15:08:05
"Was up there about a month ago, couldn't finish Garfield because of snow. I was sad panda.",SirDudeGuyFella,2013-07-15 15:38:43
I've still never seen a photo that came close to doing it justice. You really have to be there to get a sense of how utterly amazing it is. ,Leland_Stamper,2013-07-15 17:12:49
"agreed. I chose this one because it did the best of all the shots I took. However, in person it was really more amazing from the top of Mt Scott... you could see 100 miles!",elislider,2013-07-16 00:30:09

I rode my bike around that lake when it was closed to cars.  It was one of the best trips I've ever done.  That place is incredible and I'm planning on going back and doing all those hikes.,Natural_Question,2013-07-15 17:47:50

"We also met a couple at the Mt Scott lookout tower (summit) who were from Pennsylvania and on a cross-country road trip. They were coming up to Portland today so I tried to give them a few tips on places to check out. Also the guy was burly, huge beard, bald, and tattooed, so I knew they'd fit in here!",elislider,2013-07-16 00:34:40
Did you drink some of the water? I drank some of the water. Right where people were swimming and diving in but still... It tasted all pure and stuff.,yall_cray,2013-07-16 08:08:22
"We were up there in May of 2012. The clouds parted for about 5 minutes for me to get this shot, but they quickly came back in and it started snowing. If you've ever seen The Never Ending Story, the music that plays when they see the Ivory Tower for the first time is how I felt seeing the lake. Magnificent.

Your photo is wonderful.
